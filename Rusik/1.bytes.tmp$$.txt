These fungi must have broken my fall. Is this... a sewer?=Those things from before were simply unbelievable.

He even attacked me... Ugh, my head is pounding... From what I can recall, that lunatic enjoys torturing his prey in the dark.=I hurt my <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>wrist</color> and <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>ankle</color> in the fall.

Better attend to these wounds.=Did I just see my hat run off? That fall must've banged me up even more than I thought.=I'm not leaving here without my <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>hat</color>.=Hmm, did the steam scare it away?=I know! I can use these valves and vents to release the steam.=Looks alright.=I just don't feel right without my hat.=An energy crystal formed inside this cyborg-rat. I should be able to use it as a replacement power source.=Odd purple fungi are wriggling up and down like they are breathing, and it looks like their roots go deep into the soil.=These plants seem quite invasive, maybe I should take some back for research.=The puffy umbrella-shaped cover provides a buffering cushion.=These electronic spores look poisonous.

Where could it be?=The <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>tool</color> to dismantle the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>decoder</color> should be locked in here, but I can't recall the code. I really need to quit drinking.=There are no more <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>decoders</color> left, but it might be possible to get one from other household appliances with a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>dismantling tool</color>.=This is weird, there's nothing here? Did I use it recently? I guess I'll need to take one from a household appliance.=Hmmm...the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>electronic dismantler</color> can remove parts from the machine. I remember seeing it somewhere in this workshop.=Alright, now I can check which <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>household appliances</color> have a compatible <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>decoder</color>.=Damn it! It exploded!=Um... BB-X? Are you still with me, buddy?=It looks like BB-X has activated its emergency hibernation mode.=It's gonna cost me an arm and a leg to find a mechanic.

The address is still vaguely recognizable... Is it the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Underbridge District</color>?=My "friends" there would never send me gifts. I'd better scan this before opening it. Just in case.=Nothing on the sensors. Let's open it.=A fuzzy bunny rabbit? Who is bored enough to play such a prank? An eerie eyeball is sewn onto the right eye. This looks like...this is evidence from the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Scott Hotel Murder Case</color>.=There are sewing marks on the chest of the puppet. What's been sewn inside?=This device... looks like the one in the robot's brain yesterday, and this symbol on the side is from the religion Bson.=Phew...

Maybe I can use the delivery passage way to make some noise.=A mysterious room, from which strange noises can be heard. Half covered by candle wax, a plaque on the door reads "Always Wandering"... Is this the base of the Wanderer Sect?=There's also traces of Nano robots here, it seems like he was taken into the tunnel.=Okay, everything is ready. Now to watch the fireworks!=The gate inside the pipe should be open now. Time to head back.=Why is this freak so difficult? I've failed three times!=Oh, that one. You need to find a weapon that can restrain targets.=Ha, I always was a whizz with a laser cutter. Looks like this area has entered <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>OFF DUTY</color> mode. It should be easier to get around now. I should find <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Brank</color> in the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>clinic</color> for more information before letting the gang know.=An old-fashion charging device for robots, in perfect condition.=This charging device must have a past record of the robot that used it.

I'd better take it out for inspection.=These footprints are messy and staggered, they look like a drunk was stumbling around.=Brank is not very social, maybe someone slipped into his home? This is more complicated than I thought.=A simple plastic dog toilet that hasn't been cleaned up for days.=It looks like someone altered the recharge liquid, and the recharging was suddenly interrupted, perhaps the result of a break-in. It's quite likely that Brank has been kidnapped!=An old U-shaped magnet.=#N/A:125020301=The doctor is treating me now. Do I have you to thank for alerting him?=Switch for the internal water valve. It can only be opened with special tools.=I need some kind of ladder to go down.=The replenishment fluid inside has begun to freeze.

I'll bring my "little friend" just in case.=Bring along your "little friend", just to be on the safe side.=All the documents on <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> and the linked cases are here.

I need a detour to get there.=An automatic freight terminal. Interesting.=Brank's not here. What's wrong with his dog?=This must be the universal clock I keep hearing about. Taking control of it will make my life down here a lot easier. Let’s see...=The clock’s circuit board. If I can get this thing working, I should be able to manipulate the clock.=This is a special facial recognition anti-theft lock for robots. It can only be entered after the code is cracked.=Brank's home is not in the drainage pipes, so there is no need to go down there.=Is that a drone? It's a real nuisance. I'm glad William came with me. I have to be more careful.=I’ll get spotted very easily if I go up now. I need to get rid of the drone first.=It’s still fully fueled. That’s a nice change of pace!=It can't be started. It seems there’s no power supply.=If I turn the switch on, the fuel will start burning. I hope this goes well.=The fuel tank is in place, it's time to turn the switch on.=The passage is blocked by debris.

Maybe I can cause the fuel tank to explode by using the high temperature of the furnace.=The furnace is still burning. I'll be cooked unless I can find a way to lower the temperature.=So, instead of finding traces of the murderer I stumble into a secret lab run by the King! I'm going to murder BB-X for this.=Hello master. Through process of elimination, going <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>left</color> is definitely the correct option.=You bumbling box of bolts!

I guarantee that this will be the right way.=We're gonna have a long chat if I make it out of this mess.=I need to check the logistic hub information before going down any further.=Looks like that dumbass is in trouble again.

Is it the King's?=Phew, what is with this security!? Whatever's in that warehouse must be mighty valuable. I have to tread carefully from here on in.=I think I can control the incinerator from here. I'll need to unlock it first.=It won't start? I should check the device again.=Finally defused! Someone planted this here on purpose. <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> liked to use bombs in the old cases.=Okay, now I can continue checking <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the logistic hub records</color>.=It's too risky to go through it like this. I need to disable the furnace first.=○ Manual controls. I can use this to take control of the movement and actions of the electromagnetic grip.=○ There are two modes. The first can pick up and set down items weighing up to 10 tons. The second can grab items weighing up to 50 tons using extreme magnetic power, but can not set them back down.\n○ Cutting the power can force the goods to drop. Be sure to avoid the area underneath!=This should allow me to blow up the rubbish.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>The logistic hub records</color> haven't been read yet.=This switch temporarily pauses the conveyor. If I pay close attention to the timing, I should be able to avoid the drones and jump down.=Too much toxic smoke this way...=The goods are too heavy to be loaded.=Sentinel robots were eliminated a long time ago. Why is there one in Underbridge District?=Electricity leakage warning? I can probably use this to destroy the patrol drone up there.=It seems that this is the main console for the pipeline. I can <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>stop the pipeline completely</color>, so I won't be affected by the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>countdown</color>.=Time is running out. Suck the robot out with the suction pump!=This equipment controls the delivery of coolant to the furnace, and might be useful in some way...=Oh shit! A sentinel robot?! Only its eye and joints are vulnerable, I need to immobilize it!=The outer shell of the robot’s head. In order to access the electronic brain, I need to first unlock each slot and remove the covering.=I can proceed by sliding out pieces that aren’t interlocked with others. The age of this robot means that the system can't be too complicated.=A primitive form of anti-tamper protection. Modern robots don’t use this system anymore. I just need to move the signal to the center target.=What the...? There's an implanted device.=It is too dark ahead, I'd better go no further.=The cat must have pushed these documents off the shelf.=Take a look at this article. Heh, mankind is so pretentious, always feigning innocence.=This type of lock design can withstand electronic tampering and forced entry.

This half mechanical and half electronic lock can go to the museum now.=The investigation is going on in there. I must help them to find the lethal weapon.=I haven't washed my hands yet. I can't go back to drinking like this.=It should be possible to make something that meets her requirements with this music box.=This looks like the key to the operation station.=Fatty should have been born a pig, judging by the way he he's eating. A furry blue pig.=Where did that electronic waste come from?=The cyborg-rats' den, or what’s left of it after William’s rampage.=What an ugly mask! That dumb human seems to care a lot about it though. Hmmm, smells like preservatives.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>...=I can't operate the control station without the code.=Hmmm, I can probably make some noise using the delivery system.=This should cheer up that showgirl.=Mrs. Perry must be one of his supporters, because this poster is in pristine condition.=So that's what Brank looks like.=Brank must really love his pup. Or should that be loved?=This washing machine won’t be cleaning any clothes for a while.=Smells like cooked meat around here...=Looks pretty dead, might break into pieces if I touch him.=The core isn't destroyed, but the electronic brain seems to be burnt out.=All the power has been released and the control device has been burnt. It probably won't start up again.=From what they said just now, <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Brank</color> seems to have been forced to do research on these weapons. No wonder the gangs are so concerned about his disappearance.=This electric tower and the sentinel robot from before... What on earth is the King up to?=Standard morse code check list.=Sonar record time: 2140.10.22 Saturday 01:08=Sonar record time: 2140.10.22 Saturday 01:12=Sonar record time: 2140.10.22 Saturday 01:15=Hmm, so this is where my old police badge was.=I can hear the sound of freight clanking about on its way to being delivered.=There is a signal record from yesterday in the recorded spectrum, not too long from when the logistics hub was used.The murderer did something here.=A metal chair fixed to the floor, with lots of scorch marks and unidentified black crusted remains.=A container filled with some kind of chemical substance with some rotting muscle tissue attached.=There's no need to go this way now.=It's so dark in here, I can't see a thing.=I don't want to get in here.=A small electromagnetic tower.

Can't go any further.=Since I'm already here, I should have a look around.=The buildings are all very old here. Is this really the place I'm looking for?=As the old saying goes, picking up rubbish is the first step to improving life for everyone.=No point continuing. Unless I want to walk myself to death, which shouldn't take too long the way I'm going.=The coded lock is not connected to power, but the monitor camera is still working. It looks like an interesting place.=Want some ramen?=I'm pretty busy right now. Maybe next time.=Looks like there's something under construction ahead.=The shops around here are all closed due to the construction work.=The light is blinding!=As we all know, when an item goes missing, the trash always seems to be good place to look for it.=A lot of the windows have been sealed. Probably a lot of interesting stories behind them, but it's not the right time to start thinking about that.=There are all kinds of delicious snacks on the shelf.=A mysterious alley filled with strange noises.=Only high-level VIPs can enter Tang City. You aren't one of them, so get out of here now!=A classic retro arcade game, which can still work if there's a power supply.=There are many lovely animals in the café, and maids providing a very professional service.=A book about "The Prophet"? A truly revered figure among robots.=This must be the Bellflower House accommodation, so I'd better stay outside.=It stinks as bad as my armpits in there.=They're still pretty occupied. This is gonna take a while.=High heels and red lipstick. I will be the queen of the stage tonight. Come here, come here, my lost little lambs, I will take you into my palace.=I don't sell love, but I do create dreams.=Hello there my mysterious detective conversationalist. Want to come inside and talk shop with me?=The remains of Cyborg-rat with the battery pack bitten off.=Where the hell am I?=My head feels like it's going to explode...=There is no need to close it.=The flowers haven't been watered for a while, but it's clear they were previously well looked after.=According to my analysis, I just need to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>synchronize the resonance frequencies</color> of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the three small electromagnetic towers</color> and <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the main electromagnetic tower</color>, and that will force it to target something else.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>OFF DUTY</color> mode will make life much easier for me down here. There’s no need to change it.=There's an opened bag of dog food. Brank probably prepared it.=A warning on the label advises against adding unauthorized chemicals, but it seems that somebody wasn't paying attention.=No traces of a fight or struggle, and no sign of damage caused by the dog. I guess this is all the clues I'm going to get. Now I'll have to try and reconstruct how this went down.=Brank put some kind of additive into the recharging fluid tank. The recharging device sent out a warning but he gave it a manual override. The additive entered Brank's body through the recharging input port.=At 3:21 am October 17, Brank was recharging when he suddenly got up and yanked out the recharging input, which damaged his bed outlet and his own input.=Brank staggered towards the door in a very strange way, ignoring the fluid leaking out of his body. Brank exited his home and went missing.=There is no trace of another person at the scene, so Brank probably left by himself. And...=If the data from the recharge system's failed forced-wakeup function is correct, Brank left the room with his body in "dormant mode". A sleepwalking robot... That shouldn't be possible.=First the butler robot in the Mrs. Perry case, and now Brank, with the same kind of implanted device.=It stands to reason it's the implanted device that's causing both these robots to act irregularly.=Anyway, this strange fluid additive needs to be investigated. It looks like a coagulation of a certain kind of liquid Nano-substance... What exactly does this thing do?=The beef flavour dog food tastes nothing like beef. Not that I'd know.=A trail of footprints from the bed to the door. The irregular steps, suggest a staggering movement. There is condensed fluid near the footprints.=Judging from the footprints, someone must have gotten out of bed and walked out of the room in a disorderly stagger. The steps look like ones of a drunk or drugged person.=It's ravenous. Nearly bit my arm off! If there's a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> symbol on the wall, there must be something else in this room as well. Let's have a look.=There's a lot of residue from the robot recharge fluid on the bed. And the ports and tubes have been ripped and torn. Did Brank do this to his own bed?=An unreleased classic poster of the singer Sheryl for one of her shows thirteen years ago. She was one of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s better-known victims.=She was killed before that show was even announced... and this poster should have been hanging in Sheryl's dressing room. But all the investigators found was an empty space on the wall where it should have been.=So, we have a missing poster from a crime scene thirteen years ago, which turns up in a missing robot's apartment. Is this some kind of message for me?=The bunny puppet sent to me the other day also belonged to one of the victims, so that makes two things linking these events to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s case so far.=Wait a second, could this be...=This <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Power Sac</color> inside the cyborg-rat is just what I need to fire up the generator, but William damaged this one with his teeth.=There were three empty power slots in the generator, so I'll need at least three Power Sacs=Meow?=I’m pretty sure I saw some rat holes near the place where I fell. I should go there and find a way to catch some.=You've scared off all the Cyborg Rats! Now what am I supposed to do?=Meow?! Meow?!=What? You want to go in there and catch some rats for me?=Meow~ Meow~=Are you sure? You completely mangled the last rat with your teeth.=I guess you’re my only option right now. I need <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>three Cyborg Rat Power Sacs</color>. Remember, you're not allowed to damage them! I’m counting on you.=You did it! You found three <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Power Sacs</color>... and they’re all in perfect condition too!=Meow~=Don't get too cocky. You may have gotten these <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Power Sacs</color>, but you're also the one who scared away the cyborg-rats in the first place!=Meow~=This place is haunted!=What’s wrong? Why are the lights off? Didn’t I tell you to wait for me at the interchange station?=I... I think something is over at... There's something over at the armor!=???=Oh, come on! You're a robot that's afraid of ghosts? Just turn the lights on!=The lights aren't working. I think the circuit downstairs has malfunctioned.=Isn't there anything that still works in this place? Never mind, let’s find out what’s going on here first.=Meow~=Meow~=We can finally go to the interchange station now.=Can you please reset the power already? I'm starting to freak out!=What the heck is in there? Will you please go have a look? Aren't you supposed to be a psychic?=I got so sick that I was having hallucinations. Why would you think that makes me a psychic...?=Let's see what's going on here!=Ahh! This place really IS haunted!=Stop being so paranoid! One more crazy word and I'll have you disassembled.=According to my observations, I think it's a cat.=A cat?=Listen to that sound! It's difficult to hear clearly, but I'm sure that's a cat meowing.=Meow~ Meow~=The armor is stuck, I can’t get it open. I need to figure out a way to save this little guy!=According to the information I found in the archives, this armor once belonged to an ancient knight and his spirit is said to live on inside the armor after his death.=If the armor is separated from its weapon, the spirit will become enraged and place a curse on the one who dons the armor.=It's true. The curse is real!=A weapon...? I remember seeing a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>claymore</color> lying around, but I can't remember where I put it...=You must find a way to save that cat!=Stop distracting me! Can't you help me instead?=Ah... My tummy hurts... Go save the cat first... Don't worry about me...=Aha! So this must be the legendary sword. Now I remember...I thought it'd make a decent clothes hanger.=I was wondering who could have done such a silly thing.=Hey! Isn't that William?=Meow~=So you were the ghost in the armor! How did you end up in there, you silly cat?=Meow~ Meow~ Meow~=Something isn't right about this armor. You're lucky you didn’t get hurt.=Go home. I don't have any dried fish for you today.=How do you feel now?=Beep~=Hey, what's going on?=BB-X?=Beep~ Beep~=...Can you still talk?=[Zzzzt... Zzzt... Zzt...]=???=That's strange, nobody is here.=Oh, it's you. I thought it was a customer.=I'm not a customer?=Old man, do you have any cheap decoders or processors?=I'm busy in the back—the second-hand stuff is all over there, go check it out for yourself.=Leave me alone unless it's urgent.=This robot...=This thing used to serve in the army and I heard it had quite the reputation back then.=Is it a Riot Trooper? No wonder it looks so familiar.=It has so many problems that it will take a long time to fix this thing.=Whoa, hold on. These prices are insane! Have you lost your mind?=Calm down. I only sell good stuff, and good stuff comes at a price. Even so, everything you see here is at least thirty percent cheaper than the market value. It’s a bargain, really!=And anyway, you should know that it isn't easy to find parts for that antique robot of yours.=I don’t suppose you can sell them for cheaper?=If money is a problem, my offer for you to become my test subject still stands. I can compensate you with some parts!=I can’t believe you’re still thinking about that. As I said before, there's no way that's happening.=Alright then. Come back when you've got the cash. And in the meantime, leave me alone.=Whatever...=Meow~ Meow~ Meow~ Are you interested in my work?=Um, I'm actually more interested in that lever...=Meow~ You're a cat of fine taste, I see! Perhaps you are my soul mate! For you see, that is my masterpiece...=Sure... Can you give it to me?=The other cats don't appreciate my work! Meow~ Do you really want it? I will give it to you on one condition.=If you can answer three questions correctly about me and my family, I'll give you the lever.=What is my profession, meow?=A collector.=An artist.=A comedian.=Incorrect, meow.=Correct, meow!=Correct, meow! I am a rising star artist, meow.=Next question, meow.=What's The Boss's favorite quote:="Miracles come from adversity."="The dice is thrown."="Each cat has their own destiny."=Incorrect, meow.=Correct, meow!=Correct, meow! I have my own destiny too, and that is to be a famous artist!=Next question, meow.=What is the name of our rival family, meow?=Bartzni family.=Fitcher family.=Kelt family.=Incorrect, meow.=Correct, meow!=Correct, meow! Those biocats have no sense of aesthetics at all!=You answered everything correctly! You really ARE my soul mate, meow! As promised, here's my all-time greatest masterpiece as a gift, meow!=You're smart and know art when you see it! Actually, I’ve been working on a new piece. You should come by and check it out when it’s finished.=I'm so jealous of those guys down there because they get to see Miss Anna every day!=Hmm? You want to meet the Boss? I'll let you in if you can make the neon lights become the same color as Miss Anna...=Yes! This is the beautiful shade of Miss Anna's hair! With your courage and wisdom, you deserve to meet the Boss. Jump onto the platform. Meow~=Thanks to the insightful leadership of the Boss, we cats have finally driven those damn biocats from the Fitcher family out of this district.=Now we're the most powerful family around! Meow!=Martial law is still in effect. You cannot proceed without a permit, meow!=To meow with it! It seems like I'll have to pay a visit to the Boss - the infamous Vito Bourbon.=I said: you do not have permission to pass.=It seems we have to find Martin first.=Tessio took catnip again! He told us he was clean, but look at the trouble he’s caused. He deserved to be punished by the Boss! Meow!=And on top of that, who knows what disease that blue cat over there caught from the humans. He's been calling himself an artist recently.=Meow~ One of the Boss's favorite quotes is: "Each cat has their own destiny".=My destiny is to be a slave for Miss Connie! Oh... Miss Connie...=Meow~ Who is it? Lord Tessio is resting, so leave me alone!=Mr. Tessio?=Can you open the door, please? I need your help.=I am busy and I'm not interested! Leave me alone.=I need to get Tessio to come out of there. Didn’t Martin say something about <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>baked catnip</color>...?=I am busy and I'm not interested! Leave me alone.=I need to find some <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>baked catnip</color> before I try again.=This, this is...=Yes! Freshly baked catnip! Give it to me...=The Boss is such a pain. He knows I'm addicted to catnp, so he orders restrictions on it!=Meow~ Young man, show some respect to the elderly.=You must be Tessio. I need to run a quick test on you. Just relax and tell me how you feel when you see this...=Meow~ Since the Boss said so, do what you gotta do.=[Do you want to test Tessio?]=Test.=Don't test.=Let's begin the test. Please take a look at this unicorn...=Meow! What's this? You little punk, get lost if you're just going to mess around.=The test is over. Thank you for your time.=This guy is a catnip junkie. There’s no way he could fake the tinfoil reaction. He’s not the one.=Get out of here, punk. Leave me alone.=Are you ready for my questions?=I'm ready, meow.=Just a moment, meow.=Do you have any idea how difficult it was for me to get up here?=Royde? What are you doing here? I thought you'd be putting your feet up on that new lieutenant's desk of yours.=Ha! And I never would have guessed that you would be the one to report the crime. It's been a while.=Well, since you're already here, a big-shot with time on his hands like you would have figured out who committed the murder by now! Care to enlighten me?=Sir, the crime scene is under control. What are your instructions?=Karl, come over here. I'd like you to meet the famous Rex. He was on the force too.=Hmm, where have I heard that name before? Oh yes, you're regarded as some kind of hero around the station. Although personally I'm not impressed by what I read in history books.=Karl!=It's okay, Royde.=Don't mind him... Rex, tell us what you've found.=Well, first off, I actually know the deceased. She used to be a friendly face in the neighborhood before her husband died. But as for tonight, this is what I believe happened...=...So I think our next course of action should be to investigate Mrs. Perry's home in the Sophora Apartments.=I apologize in advance if you feel offended, but I think your reasoning is based on unreliable assumptions.=I believe the right thing to do is to follow the actual clues - like the stolen jewelry.=I’m not interested in your big-time detective nonsense. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to the crime scene.=Karl...! His temper gives me a headache sometimes. Rex, shall we find that apartment now?=Hey, Elizabeth! Why are you here? What's that on you? Are the street cats bullying you? Poor Elizabeth!=<color%3D#afafafff>This child knows that white cat. Maybe she can tell us something.</color>=Meow~=Hey, little friend. What's your name?=Hello, sir. My name is Alice.=Do you know this cat?=Of course I know her. She is the prettiest cat of them all and Mrs. Perry simply adores her.=Meow~ Meow~=Do you know which apartment Mrs. Perry lives in? I need to visit her.=Yes, I do. She lives in No. 303, right under my place.=We've finished our investigation here. Let's leave the rest to Karl and check out the victim's home.=Are you ready to go upstairs?=Go upstairs.=Hold on a second.=Let's go.=Come with me when you're ready.=Don't touch anything at the crime scene.=Officer Catherine, is collecting information from nearby residents.=Oh?! A-Are you... Are you Mr. Rex? M-My name is Catherine and I am a big fan of yours! C-Can you please give me some advice?=Eh, some advice? Well, this might not be the best time.=Ahem!=I'm so sorry! I still need to take notes! I'll ask you for advice again later!=Hi, sir, was there something else you need me for?=It might be a bad idea to leave now.=Mrs. Perry lives on the third floor. Can you hit the button?=We are going to Mrs. Perry's place. Don't press the wrong button.=There you are. What took you so long?=Maybe you shouldn't choose a place so far away next time.=What, the Fantasy Jellyfish? Crazy name, great atmosphere. It's far for sure, but it's also a good place for a... private chat. Today's case is likely to be suppressed by the new Special Mission Squad.=I’m still working on getting that photo you wanted. In the meantime, why don’t you tell me what’s so important about that robot?=Well, do you still remember how my body began acting weird since the incident at A003 Apocalypse Garden. The "gift" my old partner <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Abel</color> left me.=Of course. In order to save you, Abel chose to sacrifice himself. With that level of mechanical transplantation, obviously there would be some serious complications.=It was around that time when doctors identified mechanical augmentation as the cause of the physical rejection epidemic. And then you suddenly disappeared, so we all assumed...=Back then, my brain would automatically receive the thoughts and memories of the robots around me. Every day was like living in purgatory to me. But after a while I slowly recovered.=What happened then?=Most of my memories from that time are very vague. Illusion and reality intertwined in my mind. But that hasn't happened for years.=When I touched the core of that robot today, I had a similar reaction: a visual hallucination.=This time I need to fix it once and for all. My intuition tells me that the problem lies within the device implanted on the robot's brain. I need to dig deeper.=I see. I'll get that photo as soon as I can. You need to be careful here, there's more to this than meets the eye.=Since we're here, let's have some fun. I brought an old friend who you'll be happy to see.=Who is important enough to be introduced by you in person?=Hey there, Royde!=Rex? I didn't expect to see you here!=Xun?=Hahaha! Surprise!=I would never have guessed you'd bring him here.=Xun, what are you doing here? I heard you moved away a long time ago.=Hey, I can still hang out down here, can't I? I do own the place.=I don't come often though. I'm pretty busy most of the time, but I can still occasionally make time for an old friend.=Haha, Xun introduced me to this bar when I bumped into him on a recent assignment. And what can I say, it started to grow on me.=We've lost touch ever since he left the team. I heard you went to Sky City?=Were it not for my bloody family, I would have joined the Specials. I was one of the best, remember?=Stop bragging about yourself, everyone knows you bribed the training officer!=So how about you, Rex? Long time no see!=Talk about yourself.=Listen to Xun’s story.=Nothing too exciting is happening in my life. You know how it is. I have health problems, so I took some time off and stayed away from the limelight. Now I make a living by running my own detective agency.=That's easy for you to say. I did everything I could to try and contact you! I heard you just disappeared after submitting your resignation letter! That was a crazy time.=Tell me about it. We were discussing the award ceremony the day before, and the next thing I know, Rex was gone without saying a word!=Let's not talk about that. Xun, I’m curious about your life in Sky City.=Me? Well, you guys know that after the Sky City Project was put on the agenda, Sholokhov started to promote it.=Soon my family business was moved up there, and my extended family was called up to help out.=The population is growing in Sky City, but the government rarely guarantees permanent residence.=Apart from the researchers who test the data, most of the selected population are social elite types. You know how crazy they are about manners and etiquette. It's pretty frustrating.=Is it true that there are very few robots in Sky City?=Yeah. Most of the robots are dumb working units. There was a group of intelligent robots recruited during the construction, but they were all driven out later.=Let's change the topic. Wanna hear something crazy? Rex is the one who called in my crime scene today. Can you believe that?!=<color%3D#afafafff>Royde starts to explain the Mrs. Perry case, giving himself all of the credit, naturally.</color>=After the basic framework of Sky City was finished, my family moved everything up there. I've been helping with my family business since I left the team. It's a boring story.=I heard that there are no robots in Sky City?=Hehe, that's not true. The aim was to create a harmonious society in which humans and robots could get along. Nevertheless, the robot population is far from what was planned.=However, Agusto has managed to get quite a lot of robots into Sky City.=Agusto? I see him on TV often, but I wouldn't have guessed he would run for office.=Well, this election has become special thanks to Agusto's participation. A lot of things have been going on.=It sounds pretty stressful. No wonder you look exhausted.=Hah, a lot of trouble indeed! Let's not talk about that today.=You're right. Let's talk about something fun, after all this time.=<color%3D#afafafff>The three laugh about old times and catch up on the years in between. Before they realize it, a couple of hours have passed.</color>=Ugh, I'm drinking too quickly. I need to go to the bathroom.=You look like you're in trouble. You better hurry!=Excuse me, Sir! My name is Brayden and I couldn't help eavesdropping just now. Could I have a moment of your time?=[Talk to him?]=Agree=Refuse.=What is it?=Thanks! I don't know what to do anymore. Actually, my friend... My friend has been missing for several days.=I called the police, but because the call was automated and because I live in Underbridge District, I don’t think anyone paid much attention to me.=<color%3D#afafafff>[Underbridge District? That’s gang territory. No wonder the police didn’t want to get involved.]</color>=You’re that famous detective, right? I’m sure you can find her! I’ll pay you...=Eh, you know what? Let me give you my contact information first...=Send me the details of the missing person and I'll take a look.=Okay! I'll message you right away. Thank you so much!=Don't thank me yet. I haven't promised anything.=I’ve gotta go now.=Send me the details of the missing person and I'll take a look.=Okay! I'll message you right away. Thank you so much!=Don't thank me yet. I haven't promised anything.=What are you doing over there? Come have another drink!=Walk around the bar.=Go back for another drink with Royde.=You guys go on, I'm gonna look around this place a little more.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>[Finish the night drinking?]</color>=Confirm=Cancel=What took you so long?=I was held back.=Hey, it’s all on me tonight. Drink as much as you like.=I like the sound of that!=Hah! Are you sure you’ve got enough booze in this joint? You know Rex is an alcoholic, right?=No one goes home sober tonight!=Many thanks, detective. I'll send you the information later.=Elizabeth, are you saying it was you who took the candlestick away, meow?=Yes, I couldn't let Jenny hit Mrs. Perry with that thing again, so I grabbed it and ran away!=Good thinking! But it’s a very important piece of evidence. It could prove who the murderer is, so we have to get it to Rex! Meow!=Yes... But I lost it! (she starts crying)=Calm down, Elizabeth. It’s okay. What happened?=I was so scared after I jumped off Mrs. Perry’s window sill, I just started running and then all of a sudden I was in the middle of the biocats' territory! Then... Then...=Meow... It's all my fault.=Hmm, the biocats' territory... A loose billboard... I think I know where that is.=Really? That's great!=Elizabeth, time is of the essence, so I need to find that murder weapon now. Rest up and wait for me.=Elizabeth, time is of the essence, so I need to find that murder weapon now. Rest up and wait for me.=I've replaced the broken parts. Now it's time to go to the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>interchange station</color>.=Excuse me? What happened?=We need to ask you some questions.=Ask about yesterday.=Relationship with Mrs. Perry.=Did you hear anything unusual between 12pm to 11pm yesterday?=We went shopping after having lunch and didn't return until 10pm. We don't know what happened.=That's right, I saw a robot in front of apartment 303 when I left home yesterday. I don't know what it was here for.=How was your relationship with Mrs. Perry? Did she have any friends or enemies?=Well, other than some unpleasantness with the steak house at the entrance of the alley regarding street cats, Mrs. Perry got along well with most people.=She loved entertaining children at her place and the children loved her. Oh, right, she also hated robots.=Thanks, we have all the information we need. Sorry for taking up your time.=Um... Officer... I didn't do anything wrong, did I?=Relax, we just need to ask some questions.=Ask about yesterday.=Relationship with Mrs. Perry.=What did you do yesterday? Did you hear anything unusual while you were home?=I slept all day yesterday. I heard the sounds of cats and children when I woke up in the afternoon.=I thought Mrs. Perry had some children over at her place, so I didn't pay too much attention to it.=Did you often chat with Mrs. Perry? What else do you know about her?=Mrs. Perry was a loner, and she didn't talk to other people much. She took care of the street cats though and gave them food.=The people from the steak house in the alley wanted to discuss the matter of the street cats with her, but Mrs. Perry didn't want to talk to them.=Thanks, we have all the information we need. Sorry for taking up your time.=This must be Mrs. Perry's place. I'll call a professional to unlock the door.=Don't bother! Let me do it.=I didn't kill her! I-It wasn't me!=You're sticking to that story even though we have solid evidence and a clear motive? I'll extract the truth from you back at the police station.=Rex, you came right in time. This is the suspect—Christopher.=He's one of the homeless people from the neighborhood and he was pawning some jewelery at the store this morning. The jewelery belonged to Mrs. Perry.=This guy? I’ve seen him around. While he might commit theft or burglary, he isn't capable of committing murder.=First of all, the timing isn't right. According to the investigation of the corpse, the theft happened 4 to 5 hours after the time of death.=If he wanted to murder someone for their valuables, he wouldn't have waited hours before he took them off the body.=Secondly, there was no trace of him at the primary murder scene, Mrs. Perry's home.=If he wasn't present at the primary crime scene, it means he was probably the thief but not the murderer.=Exactly! You're absolutely right, sir. I stole the jewelery but I didn't kill anyone.=Based on all the evidence we’ve collected at the crime scene, the little girl named Jenny should be our prime suspect right now.=The main suspect is a little girl? What the hell is wrong with you?=Alright, Karl. Take him away and we'll talk later.=Yes, sir!=Let’s go, pal. Don’t try anything funny.=Royde is busy assigning jobs, so I'd better go examine the robot.=What... What's going on?=This is the robot's memory? Why didn't he save Mrs. Perry's life? That's already a violation of robot principles.=My head... It hurts so bad!=Hey, Rex!=Rex! What's wrong? Rex?=What's wrong, Rex? You looked like you were in a lot of pain just now.=I don't know. I think there's something wrong with this robot. There's some kind of device implanted in its brain.=We'll talk about that later. The new Special Mission Squad is taking over this case so we need to cease our investigations.=What, the SMS?! What the hell is going on?=We found out that this Jenny is the daughter of an important man.=No sooner had I retrieved her file than the order to transfer the jurisdiction of the investigation came in. And they had already arrived too.=This scene is now under our control. Leave now and stay out of our investigation.=Inspector Royde, it's quite surprising that you're asking a private detective to assist with your investigation.=Rex found the crime scene, so we asked him to help with the investigation. That's all.=You just asked him to help? Is that standard police procedure? And I’ve heard you decided to make our Miss Jenny a suspect.=Jenny, can you tell me what happened yesterday?=I was at Alice's tea party and went home when it was over.=We found your fingerprints on the tea set. You were Mrs. Perry's guest.=I-I was just visiting Mrs. Perry like I had promised. I didn't stay for long and I have no idea what happened later.=I've accessed the memories of the robot and know that both you and the robot were there when Mrs. Perry lay injured and immobilized on the couch.=The steward went crazy and attacked Mrs. Perry! I-I ran away because I was scared.=I'm afraid that's not possible. Judging from the trajectory of the blood splash, the strike came from below.=The robot steward was so tall that it would need to crouch down in a weird posture to deliver a strike that matches the evidence.=The lack of force behind the blow also makes it unlikely that the assailant was a robot. All signs indicate that the wound was inflicted by something far weaker; a child for example.=That's... I...=Miss, you don’t need to answer his questions. We’ll find a professional to record a proper testimony later.=Detective, you accessed the robot's memory <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>without authorization</color>. I can't pretend I didn't hear that.=I don't think you've found your so-called "<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>murder weapon</color>" yet either.=Meow! Meow!=I-Is that the...?=This is simply...=Well, now that we have the alleged murder weapon, all we need to do is match the blood and finger prints to reveal the truth.=Well, that's our job. Please leave immediately.=Well...=Inspector Royde, do I need to have a chat with your superiors?=That won’t be necessary. We were just about to leave...=Wait a minute, I have something for Jenny.=Jenny, Mrs. Perry wanted to give you this.=This is for me? Is this...?=What? How could this be? I didn't want to harm her (crying). Mrs. Perry, I'm sorry, it was that robot...=Jenny, about that robot, can you tell...=Enough! Inspector Royde, get this person out of here. He should never have been here in the first place!=This area is now under our control. Please leave.=Didn't you say you have something for Miss Jenny?=Hmph! Give whatever it is to Miss Jenny now and scram!=Royde, I need you to bring me a girl named <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Jenny</color>. I need to ask her some questions face to face.=Okay, I'll get her. We need to find out more about that robot too.=Yes, it's very suspicious. I need your authorization to examine him from the inside.=No problem, I'll find you if anything turns up.=Just give whatever you have to Jenny, then we'll talk outside.=Poor old BB-X. Are you just a pile of rubbish now?=Beep~ Beep~ Back-up program starting...=It's rebooting???=Program restart failed... Beep~=Hmm, I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.=BB-X still can't be started. I need to get replacement parts.=Hey, fatty, we meet again! I guess my washing basket is more comfortable than Mrs. Perry's dumpster. Is that my <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>worry-free herb</color> you've got there?=Come on, fatty. Wake up! I need that <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>worry-free herb</color> more than you do.=Hoo... Hoo... Meohoo...=Ugh... I need food to wake him up. Did I see some back at the party?=William, don't waste any time. Go find the murder weapon now. Meow!=Hey, iron head. If you don't pay up by tomorrow, you're gonna lose more than just an arm.=Hey, pal. You don’t look so good.=They pop up every now and then. I am quite used to it now.=This is my home, so I try my best to ignore their harassment. But these guys are relentless, they won’t let me live in peace. It’s probably time for me to move.=Can you help me out? I can give you something as a reward.=<color%3D#afafafff>Help the Scavenger?</color>=Of course.=I'll think about it.=How can I help you?=They threw my <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>arm</color> down below. Could you get it back for me?=OK, I'll take a look for you, but I can't promise anything.=Thank you very much.=I'm too busy to help you.=Is this your arm? It took me a little while.=Thanks stranger, I really appreciate it. Say, you don’t look like a local to me. I guess you’re here for Miracle Street, right?=Well, not exactly...=You can’t get any further without a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>. Here, take mine. I’m leaving anyway.=Thanks for getting my arm back. I don't know what I would've done without it!=Don't mention it. I hope you know how to re-attach that thing...=I'll find someone to fix me up. In the meantime, I guess you're going to the lower part of Underbridge District. Take my <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>white card</color>, I don't need it anymore and you can't proceed without it.=This is...?=With this card, not only can you go in and out of the Underbridge District freely, but you have access to Flowernight Town as well. They've got new security there, and there's no way you can get in without this.=Even though white cards only grant access to low security areas, outsiders can't acquire one without paying a lot of money.=Thank you again for your help. It's time for me to leave.=What are you up to now, troublemaker? Stay away from my treasure.=Hey! Get your filthy hands off from my precious <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>torch</color>!=Leave me alone. Can’t you see I’m busy working on my treasures!=I’m running out of patience with you! Touch my machine one more time and there’ll be trouble!=No <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>, no entry!=All you had to do was ask. I’ve got my <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color> right here...=Good for you. You’re free to enter.=Not so fast, smart guy. No one enters without a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>.=If you bribe me, I can probably let you in.=I'm not really carrying a lot of cash right now...=Get out of here if you have no money. Stop wasting my time.=Don't waste time around here, go away!=Are you trespassing? No <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>, no entry!=No <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>, no entry.=Hello there, sir. Welcome to the most exciting place in all of Miracle Street! The city's most beautiful ladies await you inside.=Is that so. Are they as beautiful as you?=I can assure you, sir, that they eclipse even my beauty!=Did you find my arm?=Wait, is that William up there on the balcony? Why is he here?=Meow~ Meow~ Meow! Meow!=Aren’t you just the cutest little kitty! Yes you are! I wish you would come visit every day.=Meow~ Meow~=That bloody cat is getting more action that I've had in the last fifteen years!=Will you help me?=Agree to help.=Refuse.=I will go find them now.=I'll think about it.=I don't know how much longer it’ll take to get this done. Our working hours have been getting longer and longer lately.=Can’t you see I’m chatting with the virtual salesperson? Leave me alone.=Excuse me, lady. Are you from the Rainbow Club?=Excuse you? Can't you see I am having a pleasant conversation with this gentleman?=Long silver hair... This is one of the missing showgirls, but she’s busy chatting with a virtual salesperson. I wonder if I can find a way to shut him up.=Dammit! You can't even trust virtual salesmen to stick around nowadays. We were talking just a second ago, and now he’s gone.=<color%3D#afafafff>[These ladies are difficult to deal with]</color>=What, you wanna chat with me, mister?=Francesca asked me to take you back for rehearsal.=What? Am I not allowed to come out for some fresh air? I can't believe she sent you to find me.=Well, do you want to talk instead?=Yeah, why not? I guess a shabby old guy like you might be desperate enough to stick around. No offense.=What shall we talk about then?=Brank=Isinglass Entertainment=I don't want to talk=Do you know a robot named Brank? He’s the maintenance worker for Kanon.=Oh, him. I know him. Rumor has it that he has a thing for Kanon. A robot and a virtual tour guide. a good match, huh?=Now that you’re asking, it occurred to me he came to our club with some bigwig from a gang last week. He wasn't looking too good that day. I’m not into robots though.=I saw you talking to the salesman from Isinglass Entertainment. Do they have good products?=Come on, you're not jealous of a program are you? Forget about him and come party at my club instead.=Thanks for the offer, but...=You should come have a look. Apart from our dance performances, we have other programs and services as well.=Ah, I'm a little rusty at this...=Well, don't say I didn't try. Come find me if you feel like talking.=It's fun talking to strangers once in a while. But now I really should be getting back to that rehearsal.=My stage name at the club is Aoide. Just drop my name and you’ll get a discount.=Do you have what I need?=Wow, where’d you find this? Never mind, I like it! Okay, time to head back to work.=Currently in <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>ON DUTY</color> mode. No entry to this area permitted, sucker.=The lady with red hair? She's wearing a VR headset, so she's gotta be the showgirl I'm looking for.=Looks like I have to wait for <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>OFF DUTY</color> mode to go active. Maybe I can help to speed things along. I should go find the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>clock</color>.=More and more of my friends are disappearing. I’m terrified! If only there was someone out there who could help us.=Shh, don’t let the patrol hear you! Do you want to be put into prison? We're not supposed to talk about any of the missing robot cases.=Be honest. You’re following me on purpose, right?=Meow~meow~meow~=Nevermind. Look, I’m kind of in the middle of something right now. Just...try to stay out of trouble. This place isn’t safe.=Well hello there! Are you a new visitor to our little coffee bar?=Hello, I'm looking for Hideyoshi. Is she here?=Yes, yes, that's me. How can I help you?=Mario asked me to pass this letter to you. He's too busy to come himself.=Oh, Oreoma! He's such a lovely man! Thank you.=Wow, I can't believe Oreoma could write such sweet poetry! I can't wait to see him again!=Great! I wish you two the best.=<color%3D#afafafff>[I might just as well ask Hideyoshi something.]</color>=Ask about Brank.=Ask about the way to A-2.=Do you know a robot named Brank? He maintains the virtual tour guides and he lives around here.=Are you talking about the maintenance guy from Bellflower House? He used to come here a lot.=Yes, that’s him. I'd like to visit his place.=That won't be easy. He lives in A-2 Zone, and you need an Orange Card  to get there.=Can I please ask, do you know how to go to the Bellflower House dormitories? I am looking for a robot called Brank who lives there.=Oh, Brank? He comes here a lot.=You could go directly there before, but the road has been blocked after Bellflower House rented out the whole area. The only access is an elevator now.=You need an Orange Card to go in now, but...=Welcome back, master. Feeling stressed? Hideyoshi's love magic can help fix it all.=I'm looking for a robot named Brank. I heard that he really likes his dogs.=Brank? Ah yes, he hasn't been here in the past few days. That's quite unusual. Is something wrong?=Can you tell me anything else about him?=He lives in District A2 above here. Yes, I remember it's A2-H7. He has a very cute Corgi, Ellie, and takes good care of flowers and plants.=Has Brank been behaving strange recently?=Behaving strange? Nothing really stands out. To be honest, Brank always was a quiet fellow.=Thanks so much for scaring him away! He is such a slimey wanker.=Don't worry about it. I'm happy to help. Now, you mentioned you could tell me more about Brank?=Well, Brank often brings Ellie here to play. He doesn't like talking very much, but he's always very polite. People here like him very much.=Oh, I remembered something that might help you.=One time when Brank was drunk on premixed oil, he complained that some gangsters were pestering him and forcing him to do some work that was really upsetting him.=Forced to work for the gangs? I see. Thank you for your information.=I still owe you for driving that idiot away! Thanks again, mister detective.=Hey! Where is my sweet little Hideyoshi?=It's that disgusting sicko again. He's been pestering me lately. I'm sick and tired of it.=Can you please do me a favor? I can tell you more about Brank when we get rid of this slimeball.=Should I help Hideyoshi get rid of their harasser? <color%3D#F39800FF>[Side Task]</color>=Agree to help.=Refuse=How can I help?=He's pretty skittish, so if you make some noise down below, he should leave.=Get going. I will try my best to hold him off.=Sorry, I'm too busy to deal with such things.=Get lost! I'm having a chat with my precious Hideyoshi.=Finally. I've had enough of him.=Here you are. Be careful though, all those patrols you see aren't just for the security of the residents.=Thanks.=Thank you so much! You are Hideyoshi's hero.=This cleaning robot has gone into hibernation mode. I need to go find a doctor.=What is it?=What's going on? Is there a problem? Guard, we must take a look!=Hideyoshi, wait for me, okay?=Seems like nobody's home.=Woof! Woof! Woof!=I hear a dog barking. Maybe something has happened to Brank. I need to get in there and have a look.=Woowoo,worf...=The dog is weak from days of starvation. Poor thing. Let's find some food for him first.=Woof! Woof!=Why are you barking? Are you taking me somewhere? Do you know where your owner is?=Should I follow this poor mutt?=Go have a look.=Wait for a moment.=Let's go. I hope you can help me find Brank.=I should look around Brank's place a little more first.=Zzz...=Elizabeth is always grumpy when she wakes up, so it's probably best to let her sleep.=Beep~ Beep~ Reboot complete. BB-X is fully operational!=Hm, this God's Touch device works pretty well. I need to ask the old man for a couple more just in case.=What a day! But still no update on Brank. Hopefully Charles will have some good news in the morning.=Charles' military chips are quite useful. I should ask him for more next time.=Well, I guess it's time to hit the sack.=Hi, meow!=Hello, William. It's been a long time. You look well.=What? BB-X can understand what I say? Has he evolved?=Beep~ Beep~ Wake up, you idiot!=Ugh, shut that noise off! Don't make me regret fixing you...=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>[Initiating self-destruct sequence...]</color>=Now things really feel like they’re back to normal! Okay, I'll get up.

I knew he would make another move, but I didn't think it would be...=I will repeat this one last time - we will take serious action if you continue to block our way.=Huh? Since when have the police been interested in Underbridge affairs?=This is a very important case. Please get out of our way before things get out of control.=Are you threatening me?=Wait! There's no need for violence. Why don't you just let me in?=Rex, thank god you've arrived.=Who the hell are you? This is none of your...=(Phone ringing)=Boss, these police officers aren't giving up, should we...? What? Oh, okay, okay, I got it.=The boss said this detective can come in, as long as he sticks close to our escort.=You have 48 hours to crack the case. If you can't identify the murderer by then...well, the boss says it's past time old debts got settled.=Rex, no...=Don't worry about me, Royde. I've been waiting for this chance for years...=Will we really need to force our way in? We don't have enough manpower here.=Mister, please be careful. I am still waiting to hear your advice!=Ooh lookie here. The special detective swaggers in to save the day. Well, shall we get going?=Should I head into Underbridge now?=Hold on a second.=Let's go.=I do love a fresh mug of sarcasm in the morning. And no, I'm not ready yet. I need to chisel my jaw first.=Take me to the crime scene. And keep the sarcasm to yourself, circuit-brain.=I can't believe the King still remembers what happened all those years back.=He just wants to see me fail again, but this time he's going to be disappointed.=Yeah, but you’re on your own this time. You don't have Abel to watch your back, so be careful, okay? And contact me if anything goes wrong.=Don't worry, I came prepared.=Right you lot! Get a move on! I want to find a back entrance into this place ASAP.=Look, Rex, I'm sorry about how I acted before. I'm not happy about this, but it's all up to you now. Good luck.=I'll do my best.=I have no doubt. Especially if <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> really is in there...=Sounds like Royde has filled you in about my past.=Just what am I going to write in my report...=Breakfast is ready. Enjoy, moron.=Why so serious all of a sudden? I can't believe that bastard dares to show his face again. Don't let him run away this time.=Don't worry.

The conveyor leads to the storage room, but the entrance is sealed.=Trust me, that's the correct route. There should be some kind of access there. It must be important if the've tried to conceal it.=I'll trust you this one time. How can I get in though...?=I told you, there's still lots of calculations to make on the data samples. It's not my fault I took over a half-finished experiment.=Shut your mouth! If Brank hadn't gone missing, no one would have ever asked a crazy chatterbox like you for help anyways.=Regardless, the experiment is on track, for the moment...=On track?! Do you know how much money we're spending on this?=Considering the size of our investment, we want more than just "on track". The organization didn't pay you for nothing.=You can't rush science just for cash payouts. And anyway, we don't have enough test subjects. What you are demanding is just...=What is it Dr. Yang? Wait, who are you?!=Um... did one of you guys order a pizza?=Well, would ya look at that. A brand new test subject just arrived!=What a time for my luck to run out. I... ugh... I can't reach BB-X. There must be electrical interference from that bloody washing machine. Never imagined I'd meet my end because of some dirty laundry.=Meow~ Meow~=William! If I wasn't tied to a chair right now, I'd kiss you! Listen, we don't have much time. You need to disable that electrical contraption they're charging.=If I'm seeing this right, you need to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>change the frequencies</color> of the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>three small electromagnetic towers</color> one after the other to match the increasing frequency of the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>main electromagnetic tower</color>. Then it should target something else.=Once the electronic circle is started...haha, they will suffer. Go now, we don't have a lot of time.=Boss, I don't see any progress in these experiments. Why does the King keep investing money? What if... we took the money for ourselves?!=Y'see, this is why you're still a loser and he’s the King! Successful people think long-term.=Yeah, yeah... whatever you say, boss.=Let's watch this guy closely.=Looks like I need to help this moron again. Maybe I can do something with this giant metal thing.=Well done, little guy! I'm sure I could have done it quicker if I was up there, but good job all the same. Now, how do I actually get to that doorway?=Wow, I didn't expect to survive that. Nice work, William. I think we make a good team: I'm the brains, and the brawn, and you are... er...=Sssss, meow!=I've got no time to deal with you. Just tell me how to open that door.=Only the boss knows how to open that door, but he's knocked out cold. You can try going out the window up above.=That did it, now we're ready! Prepare to feel the power of science!=Okay, the frequencies have been synchronized... whatever that means! That moron should be safe now.=Let's see, the origin of all these goods is still a ways down...and there's two paths to follow.=Bzz- Brrr- Connection to *Idiot Master* established.

You're surprised I can hack into your phone calls?=…I guess that makes sense. Remind me to cut off your access later!=Tell me what you see on the map.

I've heard of you, meow!=Huh, but I don't remember meeting you anywhere, meow!=Haha, don't be nervous, meow...=Meow?=If you're here, it must mean you have accepted the Boss's task.=About that "biocat", or maybe I should call him that "traitor", the Boss and I have some suspects in mind already.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Tessio</color>, one of the founding members of the family, is addicted to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>baked catnip</color>! You can usually find him taking a nap in the safe box.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Paulie</color>, the leader of the servant team, likes to imitate human ninjas and is always trying to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>disguise</color> or <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>conceal</color> himself.=There is one more suspect, and you may have already met him. This is one of the most trusted members of the family, the Boss's right-hand man... <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Bradsey</color>.=Bradsey is a suspect too?=He’s a suspect. When it comes to those damn biocats, you can’t be too careful!=I have a question.=How do you distinguish biocats?=Biocats look different to us.=How can I tell biocats apart?=The biocats of today can be easily recognized by their looks, but the "first generation biocat" we are looking for is a bit different.=Biocats look different to us, so it must be impossible for them to infiltrate the family, right?=That is indeed true in the case of today's biocats, but "first generation biocats" look exactly like real cats.=Wait, first generation biocats? I thought they had all died out?=Maybe... Maybe not. I recently found a room full of books in an abandoned apartment nearby. So I had some of the others create a library.=I found pictures of "first generation biocats", but I couldn't read the humans' writing.=But you, William, you might be able to read some of it as you are closer to the humans than most around here.=You've done your research, haven't you? Yes, I can read a little.=Perfect! Go find the materials you need in there and let me know if you discover anything valuable. One more thing, remember the law of Omerta: do not speak of this to anyone else!=The place is right behind our base and I've already told them to expect someone. Now go!=I just received a message, meow. William, you've caused me a big headache this time.=I am so sorry.=This has a huge impact on the Bourbon family, so I've been trying very hard to conceal it, meow.=I didn't expect you to reveal the secret this time, meow. Now I need to figure out a way to save my family from this crisis.=I have informed Spike. He won't stand in your way anymore. Now go and conduct your business.=I need to process the information you just brought, so pardon me for not walking you out.=William, come find me when your investigation bears fruit.=William, you were hot headed, meow~ You should have spoken to me first. Now you've gotten us into big trouble, my oh my.=Did your test yield any results?=Yes, something unexpected happened, which is why I came to talk to you first.=Oh?=According to the information I found, first generation biocats are strangely obsessed with tinfoil, so I used that to test the suspects.=None of the three targets reacted to it. However, when I was testing Bradsey, the Boss acted strangely...=Are you saying that...=Well...=You've done well, William, but we'd better keep this to ourselves.=You have completed your task, so I'll ask Spike to let you through. The biocats are rather agitated lately, you must be on your guard.=Looks like this lady needs some help.=Help her.=Ignore her.=Thank you so much, I’m feeling a lot better now.

He might have gone to see Dr. Edward.=Dr. Edward?=Ah, I neglected to mention that Dr. Edward opened a private clinic, often seeing robots for free. Robots in the area almost always go to see him when they fall ill.=The clinic is located in the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>C4 District of Night Flower Town</color>, and can be accessed directly via <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>elevator C</color>.=Welcome to Miracle Street. What can I do for you?=Ask about Brank.=Ask about the clinic.=Nothing much.=Brank is my maintenance technician. He's a very caring man, and I hear he has a lovely dog.=The clinic is located in the C4 District of Night Flower Town, and can be directly reached by elevator C.=I hope you enjoy your time on Miracle Street.=Bellflower House.=Rainbow Club.=In Bellflower House, you can enjoy gourmet meals as well as your choice of fine women.=Lady Red Feather from Happiness Mansion is performing today.

Sometimes they leave the curtains open and show themselves off to the horny men outside.=Okay, that should do it.=Damn, it’s still not working properly? I guess the problem must be with the projection equipment up top.=Hey, William, knock it off and give me a hand...=Meow~=So your name is William, eh? It seems you’re as smart as you are cute! Hehe!=Meow~ Meow~=How can I finish all these jobs by myself? For God's sake!=It looks like you have finished my task.=I'm a man of my word. Now it's your turn to deliver.=Sure.Brank lives in room <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>H-7</color> in <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>A-2</color> Zone, but the problem is that entire zone has been rented out by the Bellflower House as staff accommodation.=If you want to go in there, you need to have an <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Orange card</color>. I don't have one, but you can have my <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Green Card</color> to start with.=Because you've done well with my task, I can give you another heads-up.=Brank hasn't shown up in four days, but the King didn't ask anyone to reclaim his accommodation.=Now that we’re even, I'm sure you can figure out the rest on your own.=If you'll excuse me, I need to trick...I mean enlist...some other poor saps to help with the rest of my tasks.=Where did that chick go? I just don't know how I am going to keep this shop running.=Where did that chick go? I just don't know how I am going to keep this shop running.=Time is running out!

But there's one last problem... somebody messed up our lighting system.=There’s a control station just below us. Can you please adjust the lighting to a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>rainbow</color> color?=Anything for you, ma'am.=Wow! This looks great! Even better than a real rainbow. Thanks for your help. Do you want to come have some fun? We have great girls here.=So I see, I've already met some of them! But I can't stop right now, got things to do.=Wow... This is my kind of show!=I want to ask about the showgirls.=Aoide=Mneme=Melete=Never mind.=Aoide has long silver hair that makes me hot with jealousy. And she simply loves flirting with virtual salesmen to kill time.=Mneme has medium blonde hair and is a dog person. She always goes to play with the animals at the Maid Cafe in Night Flower Town.=Melete has red hair and is addicted to VR games. She plays on a team down in Night Flower Town.=Mister Detective. You. Are. Amazing. I could kiss you!=Hello there. I don’t suppose you happen to be a showgirl from Rainbow Club?=Hello there, sir. Welcome to the most exciting place in all of Miracle Street! The city's most beautiful ladies await you inside.=Is that so. Are they as beautiful as you?=I can assure you, sir, that they eclipse even my beauty!=It’s okay, Wright. You can tell me if you’re ill. What’s wrong with you?=I...=In my opinion, he's just faking it.=Nonsense, I have a doctor’s diagnosis.=What is it then? I'm running out of break time here.=Well...=Pardon my interruption, but are you a showgirl from Rainbow Club?=And who might you be? Oh wow, it’s almost show time.=That’s why I’m here. I’ve been asked to...persuade you to come back in time for the show at Rainbow Club.=Sure, sure...but before we go, can I ask a favor from you?=Wright is sick, but he won't tell me what's wrong with him. Can you find out for me at the health clinic in C-4?=Once I know what’s wrong with <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Wright</color>, I’ll be able to return to work.=I'll be relieved when I know what’s going on with Wright.=I’ve been to the clinic. Wright has...well...come close, I’ll whisper it into you ear...=That’s it?! Wright, why on earth were you hiding this from me?=It's just...I...=Never mind, I’m going to work now. But we aren’t done here. Not by a longshot!=You idiot, Wright! You see how worried Mneme was? Why didn’t you just tell her?=What am I supposed to do? It's so humiliating to tell her directly!=That was a horrible thing to do. I don’t care what you have, I should kick your ass right now!=Bring it on! I'm not scared!=I...I don’t want to just come out and say it!=I know you are pretending!=What happened to my VR partner? He suddenly disappeared... did he go offline? Ugh, I can’t finish this level without him.=Damn it! This is so frustrating.=Hello there. I don’t suppose you happen to be a showgirl from Rainbow Club?=Yes, I am. Did my boss send you here to find me? My partner just went offline. Can you please find out what happened?=He went offline and caused me to fail this quest. I’m not going back to work until I’ve completed it!=Do you know where he could be? In the real world, I mean...=He likes to play at <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Diamond Square in C Zone</color>, but there’s been a lot of construction work going on there lately. If he’s not there, he’s definitely somewhere in Night Flower Town.=Once we’ve finished this level, I’ll hurry back to work. He should be near <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Diamond Square in C Zone</color>. You can check out there.=Yes! I've finally nailed that annoying quest!=Thank you so much! I'll head back now.=Oh, sorry. My connection was lagging just now. My mistake.=Is she playing a game?=Perfect, that's right! Keep up and follow me!=This guy is lost in the VR game he's playing.=This must be the missing VR player. Did he just pass out?=Yawn~ What happened? Did I fall asleep? Thanks for waking me up, buddy. I’ll continue my game now.=Let’s finish this level!=Since the King regulated our time with the universal clock, I feel more and more exhausted at work everyday.=I don’t even understand why they’d want to use a clock to control us.=Who knows? Maybe they just get off on manipulating others.=That’s humans for ya. Always with their rules and regulations. Doesn’t matter if it’s animals, other humans, or even us robots with the three laws...=Its pointless to argue about it. I think it’s time for me to find somewhere new to live.=I just hate the pass! I don't understand why all of a sudden we are asked to carry these.=Totally. It was so much easier before.=I heard the gangs are trying to drive all residents away, so they started this to make our lives harder.=How could this happen?=Several areas of Night Flower Town have been taken over by the gangs. You know that staff zone for Bellflower House? I heard they made it themselves.=Never mind, I am moving out of here. I don't want to waste my time talking about this.=My head is aching! I need to see a doctor.=I'm so tired! I need a break.=Ahhhh!=Help! Help me!=That robot is in a bad way. Should I help him? <color%3D#F39800FF>[Side Task]</color>=Yes, I will.=Ignore him.=It looks like we need to find a doctor to help him.=Hmm... The situation is really tricky. It seems that there is something wrong with the power system.=Good luck Doc. If I ever break down that bad, I hope I have you around to patch me up.=This cleaning robot has gone into hibernation mode. I need to go find a doctor.=The doctor is treating the cleaner robot, so I'd better stay away.=Have you heard? It seems that more robots have gone missing.=What? I thought the police were investigating it already? Those criminals are so brazen.=I don't think the police are working hard enough.=You're right. They've always had a ridiculously low clearance rate for cases involving robots.=Oh, my, I hope nobody else goes missing!=Mr. Agusto doesn't stand a chance to win this election.=I think he participated just to look good to the public. Sholokhov has a 99% chance of winning the election.=Humans always use equality as propaganda, but never back their words with action.=Hey, don't say that. Aren't things getting better nowadays?=Well, you're not wrong about that. It does take time. Let's drink!=Wouldn't life be great if humans and robots got along as well as they do here?=Guess what I saw on Miracle Street the other day...=Miracle Street? You don't even have enough money to pay the door fees to get into the shops. What could you have possibly seen?=What do you mean by that? I saw Fancy Feather yesterday. She was on the second floor and she even smiled at me!=You wish! Do you know how much it costs to see her? Why would she smile at you?=I'm serious. I even applied for a Memory Shadow yesterday. I don't even care that it cost me half of my annual salary!=To be honest, I wouldn’t mind getting a look at her myself!=Come to my place next time. I guarantee you'll get to see her.=This isn't fair. I've been there so many times, how come I've never seen Fancy Feather?=Why do we need a pass to get through here all of a sudden?=It's just another way to make money...=Those greedy gang members.=Shush! They have ears everywhere!=Keep those words to yourself.=I heard the demolition team is down there preparing the site for new construction.=I guess so. We've gotten lots of work recently.=I wonder if there are any construction jobs available.=Who would know? Maybe your boss can help.=If there's a new project then we could make some extra money.=I paid my taxes this month, didn't I?=The rules have changed. Now you need to prepay for the entire year!=Well...=Got a problem with our rules? Didn’t you see what happened to the last guy who had a problem?=No, no, no. What I was trying to say was I don't have enough money, so can you give me a couple more days?=Make sure you bring the money before the end of this month, or else...=How am I supposed to live under these crazy conditions!=These robots are just ants waiting to be trampled.=Beep...beep...beep=Meow? This is...that smart-ass robot BB-X? Don't tell me he's gonna explode again...=Elizabeth is still sleeping, meow. I won't disturb her.=Asleep already? And the best part of today's show hasn't even started yet. Humans are dumbasses, meow.=Hey, is everything alright? You've been staring at nothing for a while.=Just... give me a moment.=<color%3D#afafafff>If he is still alive today, he must have solved the problem of the dissolving skin... I was so close to catching him that time.</color>=<color%3D#afafafff>If he is still alive, he must have solved his dissolving skin problem...Has he really come back?</color>=Your heart rate is increasing, you should try to calm down.=Relax, I am just excited. Excited that I still have the chance to catch that bastard.=(Phone ringing)=Rex, did you hear about the big case this morning?=Yeah, I heard the news. Are you sure it was... him? Can you give me some time at the crime scene?=You already know? But...=What? Is there a problem?=The problem is we haven't even been to the crime scene yet.=Why not? I’m coming over now.=The police can't get into the Underbridge District right now. The King is probably holding them up... although that's not necessarily a bad thing.=If Noa really is behind this, I’ll need to be ready. I think I should break out my Little Friend just in case.=These guys are asleep.=Zzz... (snoring) Zzzzz...=This guy is out cold.=Hey there, little guy. You got home late.=Hi Connie, why are you still here?=I've been waiting for you.=Pfft, like I would believe that.=Well, the Boss and Bradsey were organizing family stuff, so I was getting bored.=Anyway, now that you're here let's have some fun!=Sorry, meow. Today was exhausting and I'm pretty swiped.=William, meow, have you changed you mind? Let's have some fun.=Sorry, Connie. I'm more of a morning cat, if you know what I mean.=Martin?=Well, look who it is, meow. Nice to see you again, William.=Are you reading a book, meow?=Meow, I just love human books! Take this one for instance: "The Illustrated Guide to Feline Mating Rituals". The books are really well kept here, like they're new.=Actually, I think most of those books were never opened! How is it going with the Bourbon family?=The family made peace with the biocats, meow. The Boss himself went to the meeting and I heard those biocats just couldn’t wait to join us, meow.=I found out afterwards that someone from our family started the conflict on purpose, but The Boss wants to deal with this himself, so I get a couple of days to relax, meow.=That's why you're killing time reading books here?=Meow! Reading is a good way to kill time. Reading is learning, honing your mind... And these illustrations really are something...=Meow, whatever you like to call it.=Hmm, I didn't know humans had a name for that position. Interesting, meow.=Didn't you tell me you can’t read human language...=Meow haha, you must be mis-remembering.=These crazy gangs are becoming bolder by the day.=Tell me about it! Brazenly interrupting the police's job like that. What would people say if the news got out?=The Underbridge District is quite sensitive right now. I don't like it, but we'll have to send Rex in solo to investigate.=You can't be serious! A private detective instead of the police? That’s completely unacceptable.=Rex is one of us and now is not the time to argue! We need to get ready to break in if things go wrong.=Yes, sir!=I have the latest tickets for the show. You can enjoy the mysterious oriental culture and the beauties of Bellflower House! Do you want it for 20% off?=The show starts at 9pm. If you buy a ticket now, you can get a free drink.=Spend a certain amount of money to gain access to Fancy Feather’s show. Space is limited!=We offer the newest beverages, please come have a taste.=Miracle Street is always this busy.=Indeed, but it's a shame that you can't go to Mao District now.=Why is that? I think I just saw someone going in.=You need a pass to get in there now. I’ve also heard that even the locals' sleep schedules have to be in line with a strict timetable.=Another new policy? This is so annoying.=Tell me about it. It seems like there’s a new policy every day. It’s making my head spin!=Well, let’s just hang out on Miracle Street today then.=Miracle Street is awesome!=Bellflower House is going to offer limited edition jewelry.=Buy it!=Bellflower House is waiting for you on Miracle Street.=Sir, if you're lucky you might be able to meet Fancy Feather herself!=Hey, hey, hey, come have a look at the latest dance show in Rainbow Club! You can't miss it.=Not so fast, sucker. Access to the Mao District is restricted. Please show your <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>.=More <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>passes</color>? This is getting ridiculous.=The new policy came into effect last month. This area is now being managed using a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color> system and a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>universal clock</color>.=New policy. No <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>, no entry into Mao District. Thank you for your cooperation, sucker.=Not so fast, sucker. Access to the Mao District is restricted. Please show your <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>pass</color>.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>White pass</color> confirmed. You are now a winner, not a sucker. Please enter.=I can’t locate your information in our database, what is your purpose for visiting Night Flower Town?=Honestly? I’m tracking down a couple of showgirls trying to get away from Rainbow Club.=According to new regulations, Night Flower Town residents are required to synchronize their work and rest times with the new universal clock.=Only people with a pass of a certain level can access the elevator.=I trust that you’ll follow these new regulations to the letter. Thank you for your cooperation, winner.=I wish you a lovely experience there.=The boss is talking to Miss Hideyoshi at the moment. Please move along, sucker.=You're a stranger, right? This is executive staff housing, go away!=I've performed maintenance on your aptly-named Little Friend. Be careful. I'll provide remote support.=Meow! Meow!=You're still with me, little buddy? Try not to take all the glory for yourself.=How much do you think we can get for the annual bonus?=I'd say more than a hundred thousand, considering the huge growth of business this year.=Indeed. I heard you need to pay a ridiculously high price to meet Lady Fancy Feather in person.=Of course. Lady Fancy Feather has been the most popular for three successive years! I've never seen that before!=I wonder what it'll be like when Fancy Feather shows up next year.=I'm really looking forward to that.=Why did Ellie suddenly run out? Is Brank not at home?=Well, Brank has been getting more and more arrogant lately.=What's up, what's the story?=A few days ago, I met him on my way back from drinking in a bar and greeted him. He walked away, completely ignoring me.=What else? Maybe he was thinking about something and wasn't paying attention. He always greeted me warmly.=Hmm, I think he just got close to the gangsters and started getting stuck up.=I spent the whole night decorating the petal bath room yesterday. It's getting harder and harder to serve these ladies.=Tell me about it! If not for Fancy Feather, we would have been given even more work.=You're right. Fancy Feather remembers the old days.=It's been a year since Angela left. Last month I heard that she's working in a bar now.=I want to leave this place too.=I would love to get a look at the outside world if I had the chance.=I haven't been to the game room for a long time. Kinda miss it.=Wasn't the game room closed last month?=Don't you know? It was reopened in B-2 District last week.=Really?! Let's go there later.=I don’t know any of the latest games.=Where are you from? Don't you know the rules? This is my territory! Go collect your rubbish somewhere else.=Hideyoshi is cute and attractive.=The equipment that's been getting shipped over lately is so strange.=I agree. The stuff that came in last time didn’t look like any project material I’ve seen before. Seemed more like some kind of advanced technological device.=Are you saying the King is driving people away because of some secret experiment?=Keep it down! What if the supervisors overhear us?=Alright, alright, I've said too much.=There is so much stuff coming in recently...=Since the King regulated our time with the universal clock, I feel more and more exhausted at work everyday.=I don’t even understand why they’d want to use a clock to control us.=Who knows? Maybe they just get off on manipulating others.=That’s humans for ya. Always with their rules and regulations. Doesn’t matter if it’s animals, other humans, or even us robots with the three laws...=Its pointless to argue about it. I think it’s time for me to find somewhere new to live.=Lady Fancy Feather is so popular, but I'll beat her one day! Hmph!=Sir, I heard the Cloud Pavilion Dance at the Rainbow Club is really something to see, the showgirls there are gorgeous!=Their lights are off. Maybe they aren't open today?=Let me see. They're supposed to be open in an hour.=We can come back later. There are so many hot babes here on Miracle Street, it's making me sweaty under my fur coat.=Yes, sir, you're right! Er, right about the hot babes, I mean.=You’ll need to keep a close eye on our schedule. I don't need to tell you what the consequences will be if anything goes wrong, do I?=Absolutely, sir. We’ll take a walk around Miracle Street now and catch the six o'clock show at the Rainbow Club. After that you'll be attending a business banquet in Tang City.=You don't look well. Can you still do the show tonight?=I won't go tonight. I'm not feeling good today and all the guests are there to see lady Fancy Feather anyway. There is no point going.=All right then, I've actually got today off. Let's do something together.=Okay! There is a shopping festival in the Yin Zone. Why don't we go there?=Shopping always makes you feel better, right?=Shopping keeps me alive.=Woof~ Woof~ Woof~=What he said just now is that your scent makes him uneasy.=Just you wait...once I catch my breath...I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget!=Oh yeah? You think I'm scared of you? I'll show you who's boss...as soon as I get my energy back...=Jesus! What the hell happened in here?! That's a giant Bson symbol on the wall!=No signs of theft or robbery... Yeah, this is a signature <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> crime scene, so the purpose of the bunny parcel was to bring me here. But why? Well, I suppose I do recognise these crazy symbols from <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s old crime scenes.=Woof! Woof!=What's wrong with this dog?=Judging by this poor malnourished pup, Brank’s been gone for a while.=Woof! Woof!=Poor thing. Let's find you something to eat.=Stop sniveling and tell me: do you know what you did wrong?=Y-yes I do. P-please forgive me, Lola.=Aaah! It's you. Here, please take this. I won't do it again.=What the...=It's your wallet, mister. See if there's anything missing.=Yes, everything’s here. Thank you so much.=You're welcome. Don't worry, I'll teach him a lesson.=You. Stand there.=Yes ma'am.=How DARE you steal again! Didn't we talk about this already?=I know, I know. P-please, Lola, no more...=Huh? What's up?=Surrounded by dogs... Are you a dancer at the Rainbow Club? Francesca is looking for you.=Ugh, of course. The show’s about to start. But I don't really want to go back!=Tell you what, there're some questions that have been bothering me. If you can help answer them, I'll go back.=Well...=Answer her questions.=Refuse.=Okay, but I don't want to go back without figuring out the answers to my questions.=Are you ready? I will start now.=I know dogs stick out their tongues to cool down when it's too hot in the summer, but why do dogs stick out their tongues in the winter?=Because of heat.=Because it's cold.=Because they're panting.=Dogs pant faster when they are nervous or excited, so they also stick out their tongues to calm themselves.=That sounds about right. Next!=Dogs are trained to follow instructions. Can they understand what people say?=Yes.=No.=Dogs can't understand language, but they can understand tone. They know what to do when they hear certain tones.=What a pity. I thought Lisa could really understand me.=Do dogs only eat vegetarian food? Some people feed their dogs fresh vegetables and fruits. Sometimes I see dogs grazing on the weeds between the old train tracks.=Yes.=No.=Dogs don't absorb vegetable protein. Long-term feeding of fruits and vegetables can often result in death. Dogs may eat grass to clear their stomach, but if they eat a lot of grass, they should be taken to the vet for examination.=Oh, really? Wow, thanks for the warning!=You're pretty smart for a detective. The last person to answer my doggie questions so well was Brank.=Brank? You mean the maintenance technician? Do you know him?=Of course, he often comes here with Ellie. She’s so cute!=Oh sorry, you probably don't know Ellie. She is an absolutely giant Corgi.=I'm going back to rehearsal. Thank you for helping me with my questions.=I don't think the answer is right. Do you want to think about it again?=It's so nice here. There are so many lovely pets and so many lovely maids like Hideyoshi.=Hmmm, I don't want to go back until I've solved the problem.=Answer her questions.=Refuse.=Hi, Mr. Detective, you have a parcel.=A parcel?=The parcel is addressed to Mr. Rex. There you go. Have a good day.=You are... <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>! What the hell is going on?=Long time no see, detective...=Bson... will lead... us... to fusion.=The global conflict... started... from separation... combining... robots and humans... Bson will fuse and fusion will connect... take us to a new land...=That sounds like... Yes, these are the beliefs of the new god <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>. He would use the holy mark of Bson as his symbol. After the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Arthur Fory Town Case</color>, this symbol was found at a great many crime scenes.=These new believers claim to belong to the Roverist church, but I'm not sure there's any connection between them and <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>.=Have you been to the clinic lately? Dr. Edward's wife looks even younger. Has he got a new wife?=I think it's the same woman, but she does look much younger.=The doctor must be working on some anti-aging medicine. I need to get some for my wife too.=Isn't your wife an AR smart companion projector?=Shut your mouth!=It's great to have a young wife.=Ahem, hello ladies! Hopefully my "little assistant" didn't annoy you too much. If you like cats, I have many at home. Do you want to come over to my place later to have a look at them?=Hisss...!=Looks like this little guy doesn't like what you’ve named him... Mr. Detective...=You know who I am?=Haha. It doesn't matter whether we know you or not...if the King knows you’ve snuck out here to have some fun, Miracle Street is bound to see some action.=Er, it turns out I’m busy today, so I’ll have to show you the cats some other time.=Okay, Mr. Detective. Hope to see you again sometime.=Mr. Detective, are you still hanging around? Don't you have a case to crack?=Um, well, er... It's nice to be able to see you again.=What a charmer you are. We might be seeing each other a lot in the near future...=Do you know why everyone calls me "Mr. Zha"? Haha~=The noodles in this shop taste so good, I should come here with my sister next time~=Cyborg-rat’s energy storage pouch=Cable=Mechanical Wrist Component=An energy crystal formed inside this cyborg-rat. I should be able to use it as a replacement power source.=Sealed cable wires.=Professional mechanical wrist parts, the surface of which has suffered severe erosion.=A robotic skeleton, probably been here for a long time.=Abandoned robot, now a home for mice.=This bizarre purple fungus is pulsating, almost like it’s breathing.=These plants seem quite invasive, maybe I should take some back for research.=The puffy umbrella-shaped cover provides a buffering cushion.=It’s unfortunate there's no power, but the cable seems to be in good condition.=Looks like this robot took a fall too...=Examine BB-X in the workshop.=Find replacement parts for BB-X.=Return to the workshop to fix BB-X.=Go to the repair shop for parts.=Restore power in the workshop.=Return to the workshop for investigation.=Retrieve the missing two-handed sword.=Find the processor.=Find the decoder.=Examine BB-X in the workshop.=Return to the workshop to fix BB-X.=Go to the repair shop for parts.=Restore power in the workshop.=Return to the workshop for investigation.=Retrieve the missing two-handed sword.=Dear Jenny,=You are such a kind and loving girl, the way you always drop in to visit me. Today is your birthday, and you are about to become a young adult. I know you like little Elizabeth very much, so I have decided she is to be your birthday present. I know you will be good to her because you are such a loving child. I have also made a nameplate for her collar, which has been engraved with your name. Starting today, Elizabeth is yours. I hope that you will grow up happily, and I will always be there to serve your favorite cakes and fruit teas when you want them.=Your Grandma Perry=Rex=William=BB-X=Mrs. Perry=Royde=Karl=???=Alice=Christopher=Jenny=Morax=Martin=Falkenburg=Rocco=Fred=Tom=Spike=Tessio=Bradsey=Vigo Bourbon=Connie=Paulie=Spike=Vorkin=Katherine=Xun=Braden=Elizabeth=Royde=Jenny=Elizabeth=William=Rex=Katherine=301 residents=301 residents=302 residents=Robot=Weaving=Man in Black=Other Man in Black=Drunk Lady=BB-X=Falkenburg=Big-Bellied Gang Leader=Sven=Ben=Custom Official=Gangster Guard=Cyan Songstress=William=Fancy Feather=Kanon=Francesca=#600123=Aoide=Nanco=Red0-09=Swordfish-A68=Hideyoshi=Derrick=Dick=Melete=Wright=Webster=Blue=Dr. Edward=William=Mneme=Airi=Elizabeth=BB-X=News Report=BB-X=Phone=Royde=Karl=Derrick=Phone=Royde=Vorkin=Katherine=Supervisor=William=Rex=Countdown=BB-X=Dr.Yang=Joseph=LQ-35Rd=William=Paul=William=William=Snow C03=Witch D128=Mullet Stacey=Green Hair Mike=Raven #12307=Luke=Jason=Vania=Peter=Mr. Know-It-All=Elliott=Exhausted Robot=Frustrated Robot=Passerby Series-5=Royde=Queuing Man=Queuing Woman=Queuing Worker=Queuing Big Guy=Blue=Big-Bellied Gang Leader=William=Elizabeth=Martin=Connie=Falkenburg=William=Watermelon=Blue Kimono Girl=Red Kimono Girl=Kimono Lady=Makeup Artist=Noodle Terry=Robot=Fashionable Woman=Strange Guy=Cyan Songstress=Huggable Bear=Security Robot=Bellflower Employee=BB-X=First Staff Member=Second Staff Member=Reach GX=Great Wall 68=Baseball Cap Kid=Electric Mike=Junkman=Starry Eyed Girl=Young Workman=Veteran Workman=Exhausted Robot=Frustrated Robot=Clean-Shaven Maid=Fortune Teller=Bathrobe Betty=Smirking Crony=Wealthy Boss=Woman With Flowery Hair=Afro Woman=Chef "Extrordinaire"=Gangster Guard=Acid=Vega=Synthetic Voice=Purple Songstress=Lola=Robin=Delivery Girl=Followers of Bson=???=Manuel the Gossip=Billy the Gossip=Fancy Feather=Cephiso=Apollonis=Mr. Zha=Rex=Detective=Sunlight Street, 222B=He lives downtown on Sunlight Street 222b in a three-story apartment which reveals his affluent past; however, he is barely making ends meet nowadays, earing his income working as a detective.=Liquor has become an indispensable part of his life, and he can usually be found in a state of intoxication.=After graduating from the police academy, he became part of the Special Mission Squad investigating the "Sculpture Murders" under Royde's command. After the Special Mission Squad was disbanded, he joined the "Anti-Revolutionist Special Squad" and won the "Hero's Medal" for his excellent performance during the suppression of riots, as well as his success in terminating the leader's plot.=Almost half of his body is mechanical, and it is considered a miracle that he survived his body's intense rejection of the augments. He has a habit of concealing his unique physical structure from prying eyes. BB-X helps him to maintain the mechanical parts of his body.=BB-X=Housekeeper=Sunlight Street, 222B=A very old robot with some legacy military fittings. It's difficult to find parts for this model nowadays. Due to it’s outdated design, this type of robot only functions well upon receiving detailed instructions.=Although BB-X is prone to making silly mistakes, Rex puts up with him for the most part. While Rex likes to scare him with threats of replacement or disassembly, he's never actually followed through. There seems to be something about BB-X that Rex finds comforting.=BB-X who got a second life by using Charles’ special parts seems to have some unusual functions. For example, he often talks to black cat William even though they don't speak each other's language, or he swears all of a sudden while cooking. He is still as confused as he has ever been, so he should never be trusted to navigate. Nothing is worse than that.=Mrs. Perry=Unemployed=Sophora Apartments=The landlord of the Sophora Apartments, an old-fashioned apartment building with comfortable rooms and reasonable rent. She always feeds the street cats, resulting in a rise of cat activity in the neighborhood. She sometimes feels bad for her neighbors because of this.=Mrs. Perry was a baker when she was younger, and was really good at making desserts. Now she entertains the local children with her desserts and flower tea.=Royde=Police=Starlight City=Rex's chief back when he was on the force. He is a good man, but has trouble getting promotions due to his distaste for kissing the butt of his superiors.=With a wealth of professional experience, he can find the key to solving the case by examining the finer details. However, he can be a bit too cautious and usually works as part of back-up teams.=He likes to touch his chin while thinking. His own reason for this is that it calms him down and clears his mind.=Charles=Mechanical Engineer=The Underbridge District=He runs a private workshop on Square Street in the Underbridge District and knows a lot about robot quantum brain technology. Just like Morax, he is quite interested in Rex’s physical make-up.=Once a well known mechanic, Charles participated in research on smart robots and achieved outstanding results. However, for unknown reasons he took his grandpa to the Underbridge District and opened up a workshop there.=Lola=？？？=The Underbridge District=Charles' granddaughter lives with him in the Underbridge District. She has been Robin's friend from childhood, so she worries about Robin and teaches him lessons when necessary.\nShe has some experience with mechanical maintenance as she grew up in the workshop. She likes inventing things and inherited her grandpa's talent for machines.=She hangs around with Robin and Nanco. Maybe it is due to the gender difference... But Lola is the most dependable person of the trio. Robin and Nanco respect Lola's opinions. Lola is definitely the decision-maker of the team.=Robin=Rangers=The Underbridge District=A child of Underbridge. His parents were both junkmen and he has been supporting his sister and himself since they passed away. His difficult upbringing is evident from his troublesome personality.=Because of his difficult upbringing, he values obtaining resources over moral standards. His closest friends are always on his mind, but he often doesn’t know how to communicate with them. \nHe prefers taking action over planning, and he wouldn't hesitate to try something without much second thought. He is sometimes rash, and he is the action taker on the team.=Jenny=？？？=She impresses people with her cute outfits, and usually displays elegant manners thanks to her great upbringing. She seems to possess social skills beyond her years.=She hates street cats ever since her own pet cat was killed by one. She can seem rather distant and often hides her true personality.=William=Stray Cats=Sunlight Street=A black cat who likes to stay clean, he appeared one day at Mr. Mist’s place and has returned ever since for food. He seems to have a thing for cats with white fur. Mr. Mist originally planned to kick him out, but William displayed remarkable comprehension and understanding of his directions, leading to him assuming that William must have received some type of special training. \nNow, William often finds himself completing tasks or retrieving items in exchange for delicious dried fish.=William's parents were likely pure blood cats, so why he lives on the street, contending with other cats for food, remains a mystery. Once the victim of bullying, William has grown into a good fighter who is known for his fierceness in battle. Before Mrs. Perry started to feed the street cats, William was in control of the area's supply of cat food, resulting in many street cat families leaving the area.=Morax=Repair Shop Boss=Sunlight Street=Morax runs a repair shop on the street, originally named “Repaiy Shop”. But if you ask him about that name he might set the Violence Tromper robot on you! Eventually the name was changed to "Repair Shop", but people immediately began to miss the typo. Morax buys and sells all kinds of second hand machines and electronic parts, and of course he sets the price himself.\n He seems to have a special channel to acquire repurposed military parts. Morax is undoubtedly a very good mechanic, and he is also interested in all sorts of eccentric questions about new technology and machines.=There is a rumor that Morax is actually some kind of immortal, or that he has turned himself into a bio-robot being.\n People like to remark that he looks the same as when he first opened the repair shop twenty years ago. Time seems to have no influence on him.=Nanco=Amateur Sleuth=The Underbridge District=He is a robot adopted by Charles, who knows everything in the Underbridge District. He works odd jobs for residents near the workshop for money. He may look like a child on the outside, but his age is a mystery.=He is good at collecting information and he has his own perspective on things. Calm as he is, he is never controlled by his emotions. He is a friend with Lola and Robin, and his role is that of a smart consultant for the trio.=Nanco has been focusing on the missing robots cases, and he has asked his friends to help track down any relevant information. Their daily meeting in Charles' workshop at six o'clock has become a routine for the trio. Through consistent observation, Nanco gradually acquired some information. Those missing robots have all been to Edward's clinic. Is it just a coincidence? Nanco keeps investigating although he has some growing suspicions.=Brank=Technician=The Underbridge District=Brank was the maintenance technician for virtual guide Flower Tune on Miracle Street. When Charles was carrying out the maintenance work on Brank, he found that a device had been implanted into Charles' brain, and he left it intact as it was connected deep into the structure of the quantum brain.=Brank hadn't shown up for the past few days and he seemed to be having headaches. Brank had a strong sense of responsibility towards what he did and he had a strong love for pets. His pet dog was his family and he talked about his pet all the time to people around him.=He had health problem caused by dog hair clog，so he went to Doc. Edward's clinic for regular maintenance weekly. He liked walking the dog in the Cafe in A3 Zone and was popular among dog lovers. However, there had been rumors about him as he seemed to be quite close to the gang members.=After he went missing, the gang members on Miracle Street had indeed been looking for him and poeple suspect that the doctor has something to do with Brank's missing. Brank had disappeared from down street and no one knows where he went.=After being missing for couple of days, the body parts of Brank appeared shockingly on the square of Miracle Street, and they were made into a horrifying sculpture with body parts of other victims that had gone missing. This kind of crime is quite similar to the "sculpture" serial killer case many years ago.=The twelfth card of the Hugot Deck: Inverted in Water.

That madman <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> is a believer of this Bson...=Pray to our Bson! He brings with him a birth twig, walks through the yard of God and brings the lost ones vivid expectation by spreading God's waves.\n
God of reception! We sing for you! Our bodies are flesh as well as iron, and you will guide us into fusion.\n 
All the people sing for the praised God of fusion and communication, Bson! Bson! Bson!\n
You are the King of the birds, you lead our lost souls, we will follow your hands and embrace the terrain of Gods.\n 
By that time, humans and robots will be fused into one being, in the arms of God.\n
Come here, the messenger who walks through the yard wins and will play the song of God's wave.=A wrinkled flyer full of fanatical praise for Bson -- The God of fusion and communication in Roverism.=Various medals awarded by the police department, all covered in dust.=Full of unwashed clothes.=Some formal clothing.=Some fancy clothing.=An old-fashioned game console, but the cassette is broken. If I find new ones, I could play games here.=The decoder that BB-X needs is not here.=Needs an alcohol top-up.=The apartment power distribution box. Locked when not in use.=The apartment power distribution box.

Time to go back and check the workshop.=No time to visit the bathroom now. I should finish up with BB-X.=Workshop on the third floor.=Living room on the first floor.=I still play with it, so I'm not about to take it apart!=If this is dismantled, I'll need to go to the kitchen to get booze in the future. Not gonna happen!=This washing machine seems like it's even older than that antique robot...=Photos of the Secret Service team. Some are missing.=Hard to believe...after all these years...this “beak mask” is all we could recover...=How did this watch end up here? It's ironic how I didn't even give it a second look back then.=After Sky City was completed, even the sun that hangs in the sky at noon has become artificial.=This morning's newspaper? Let me have a look... It seems like everyone is talking about Agusto's participation in the campaign.=Electronic Artificial Eyes=Enhanced Mechanical Arms=Mechanical Lower Limbs=Half-Mechanical Brain=Bionic Internal Organs=Bionic Mechanical Hands=???=I had artificial eyes implanted when I was on the police force's Special Team. My eyes have multiple view amplifying functions and can switch between different identification modes. They come in handy at a crime scene. However, because the eyes haven't been serviced for a long time, many of the functions are no longer working, and even the basic night view mode is now giving me problems.=This mechanical arm was installed after the Apocalypse Garden Incident. Its internal structure is made of titanium alloy, greatly improving its strength. This was the most advanced design at the time; however, just ten years later, it's already out-dated.=Bionic mechanical lower limbs, which house bionic muscle tissues connecting to titanium alloy bones. I recently replaced my old knees with new ones from Morax's repair shop, so I don't know why they are already malfunctioning again.=During the Apocalypse Garden Incident, in order to save my life, my partner merged part of his own electronic brain with my damaged brain, altering them both drastically. According to official records, this is the only living case of a human brain merging with an electronic brain. Although this procedure is completely banned, the authorities turned a blind eye on the incident due to the extenuating circumstances and what they said were my outstanding contributions. This incident has been kept secret from the public.=My right lung, liver and several other internal organs were seriously damaged by an explosion during the Apocalypse Garden Incident. My family organized the replacement of these damaged organs with the most advanced bionic artificial organs. This technology is only available to the powerful and wealthy residents of Sky City. But because I'm a stubborn old horse I refuse to go back to Sky City for regular maintenance. It doesn't help that I like a drink or two, and that messes up the accuracy of the test data.=Mechanical hands, complete with a great number of sensing devices at the tips of the fingers. The fingers can simulate the touch and feel of real fingers with great accuracy, making them capable of numerous precise operations. However, because I always forget to apply joint oil, the joints have serious wear and tear. If they remain unmaintained, increasingly bad mobility problems will occur.=What are you doing here? This is still the original packaging.=Warrior armor haunted by the first owner's spirit.=#N/A:110080201=Cluttered up with recently completed work.=I recovered this old chair from a crime scene...after the impaled victim was removed, of course.=Old police department skill tophy, now filled with cat food.=Worry-Free herb.

It was severely damaged at first, so I upgraded it to an electronic version.=There are all kinds of masks hanging above the fireplace. People in ancient times wore masks to hide their fears, but now they can’t take them off.=Locked cupboard. What's inside is not helpful right now.=I've collected all the parts I need. Now let's go back to the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>workshop</color>.=There are many books about genetic diseases on the shelf. In order to catch <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>, I have done quite a lot of research in this area. I wonder if that guy is still alive?=I don't have time to go downstairs.=Sobering drug recipe obtained from a special channel, works pretty well after some improvements.=I can't believe people are still putting up posters like this. When will humans and robots be able to put aside their differences?=The addition of robot candidates has made the elections unexpectedly popular, but this promotional video seems to only feature humans.=Did he just ditch me for a female cat? He was begging me to play with him just a minute ago. I guess gals before pals stands true... even for cats!=Oh well, I need to visit the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>repair shop</color> anyway.=I should finish my task before going back home.=The repair shop won't be of any help to me. I'll need to try something else.=Closed!=You're closed this early? That old man is such a slacker!=I can’t think of anyone other than Morax who would know about that implant device. I think it's time to meet Royde at the bar now, anyway.=That's enough wandering. I better go to the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>repair shop</color> now.=I used to take a bus here to the police station.=All these sugary beverages are so unhealthy. Beer, of course, is different...=All sorts of fast food. The Kongbao Chicken looks good.=Robots' instant food is hard to swallow.=A detective used to live here but he was taken away by police for beating up corpses at home. No one knows what he's doing now.=The best thing about tattoos is that they help with identification when a corpse is found.=Hmm, should I take a taxi to the bar?=Take a taxi to the bar.=Wander around for a bit more.=It's time to head to the bar. I was getting thirsty anyway.=I'm not ready to leave just yet.=William brought over a piece of ripped cloth with blood on it. Whose blood is that?=Opposition against intelligent machines reached its peak more than a decade ago, but hostility through the posting of leaflets and posters is still going on today.=Mayoral election propaganda are being played on the screen, introducing the candidates from various angles. Even thought he is the only robot candidate, Agusto only had a few shots.=Royde is assigning a job to Walkin.=Karl is still questioning Christopher, while Katherine is taking records of the scene.=This ramen restaurant has kept the same great taste for the past ten years. I'll stop by next time.=The steak house is closed.=No need to go down this street.=That hallucination just now... If that really was the last memory of the steward, then he managed to break through the confines of the three principles. The last time this happened, a revolution broke out and my body was left in this state...=What concerns me more is that strange implant device. I haven't had a hallucination since the Apocalypse Garden Incident. I thought I'd rid myself of that nightmare for good. I never imagined it would emerge once again.=The invasive voices and frantic memories drove me insane and I was completely unable to escape from it... I never want to experience that lack of control again.=Perhaps this implant device is an opportunity for me to rid myself of this "disease" forever...=I wonder whether Royde was able to get the photo of the device. Darn it... I could really do with some booze now.=There are no little wizards living here.=It's blocked and I can't open it from out here.=Is that tin foil in his hands? Is it okay for this guy to be playing with tin foil all the time at work?=He seems to be fast asleep...=Humans always enjoy the role of the Creator, but one day they will face the consequences of their actions.=Shit, a dead body! Been dead for a while now... Wait, I know this woman. It's Mrs. Perry! She's the landlord at Sophora Apartments!=I need to call the police immediately.=Hello, I'm calling from the Sophora Apartments. There is a body lying among the trash in the alley, please send someone quickly. Okay....yes.....thank you.=There must still be some evidence here, since not many people come this way. I'd better look around before the police arrive.=Strangely shaped wound.=Gash possibly formed when hit by something blunt.=Livor mortis on the face, disappears when pressure is applied.=Livor mortis on the leg, disappears when pressure is applied.=Livor mortis on the arm, disappears when pressure is applied.=Skin on the neck exhibits nickel allergy.=Left hand middle finger displays a ring mark.=Postmortem abrasions on the heel, formed after rigor mortis set in.=Postmortem abrasions on the left elbow, formed after rigor mortis.=A slipper, the other one is missing.=A small amount of oxidized blood on the clothes.=Dislocation of the wrist with signs of fracture, probably caused by falling down or a strong collision after death.=There is a strange wound caused by impact with something blunt, most likely the cause of death.=Liver mortis indicates the time of death is probably more than 24 hours ago.=Traces of jewellery worn on the neck and the left finger. Signs of rigor mortis are different from other areas, so the theft probably happened 4 to 5 hours after death.=There are scratches on the elbow and heel, and they seem to have formed after death. The corpse was moved at the time of the theft.=#N/A:110130401=#N/A:110130402=At about 9pm yesterday, Mrs. Perry fell straight onto the dumpster from above, leaving this dent on the lid.=Not long after, a thief appeared and skulked around the corpse for quite some time. He or she hesitated, but decided to steal from the body in the end.=After that, the corpse was dragged from here to the trash pile and covered with garbage bags. However, the thief did not clean up the traces and marks that were left behind.=Judging from the time of death and the time of the theft, as well as the thief's behavior at the crime scene, the thief is unlikely to be the murderer. That person was possibly attracted here by the sound of the fall.=The thief committed theft on impulse after seeing the valuables on the deceased.=The deceased fell down from her own apartment. I might be able to find out why Mrs. Perry was killed if I investigate the Sophora Apartments.=Have they finally arrived?=For hygiene and health issues, please do not feed the street cats.=A temporary shed for street cats.=Clear traces of dragging on the ground, surrounded by foot marks. Judging from the footmarks, the person was thin in stature.=The dragging starts from here with more traces nearby, and these footprints all seem to belong to the same person.=There is a new dent on the steel lid, which must've been caused by a heavy object falling onto it.=#N/A:110131401=A fat grey cat is sleeping soundly on the dumpster.=I'll follow William to see what's happening first.=The police aren't here yet.

I'll need to move it to find out more.=The suspect stole the jewellery, moved the body and tried to cover the trace with a blanket.=The marks on the ground continue in this direction.

It looks like the murderer has taken it.=The windowsill is clean, but there are some cat paw marks with traces of blood.=A group of unique wind chimes.=Although the pattern on the bottom of the candlestick is similar to the shape of the fatal wound, there's no trace of blood there.=The <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>murder weapon</color> must be another <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>matching candlestick</color>.

These blood stains appear to be an attempt to clean up blood splatter.=An obvious pressure mark can be seen on the tablecloth. Something has been moved away from it.=Complete white candle.=Mrs. Perry's finger prints.=Fingerprints are located on the candlestick. From the look of the candle, it’s only been used for a short time.=There are some intricate patterns carved on the bottom of the stand, similar to the shape of Mrs. Perry's wound.=There should be another matching candlestick.

Let's see what other information we can find.=There are fingerprints and lip marks from Mrs. Perry on one of the cups. The other cup has marks left by...a child? We need to find out who this is.=Wearing a clean and tidy servant uniform emblazoned with a family crest.=Brand new shoe soles with clear patterns.=Soft artificial fingers.=A close inspection of the robot's eye reveals its current status code.=Dried blood stains.=Some hair belonging to the deceased is visible on the hands.=The soles of the shoes were stained with Mrs. Perry's blood, and it was tracked all the way to the sofa.=The status code indicates that it has shut down.=#N/A:110171209=This kind of robot can access its internal programming from here.=It's a highly intelligent model: an S-T2 smart robot.=#N/A:110171212=Judging from his clothes, this robot is an indoor servant worker who paid attention to manners and details. The crest indicates that he was working for a specific family.=The hair and blood are confirmed to be Mrs. Perry's, so he is highly likely to be involved.=The status code indicates that it has shut down.=This robot housekeeper seems to be involved in the murder, but I don’t understand why it’s just standing here.=There are clear bloodstains on the couch, so this must be the spot where Mrs. Perry was murdered.=The tea was made yesterday judging by the tea stains and residue. Mrs. Perry had a little guest before she died.=There must be an identical candle stand somewhere - the murder weapon!=Mrs. Perry's diary? There might be some clues inside, and the key should be somewhere in the house.=The last page of Mrs. Perry's diary revealed why she hated robots.=I should finish examining this room before going any further.=There's something peculiar about this set of cat paintings. There seems to be some hidden switches in them.=Mrs. Perry entertained her little guest in the living room with fruit tea, and the two of them seemed to have had an argument for some reason.=The guest struck Mrs. Perry with a candlestick matching the one I found.=The strike didn't kill Mrs. Perry immediately but immobilized her. She died sometime afterwards.=The robot entered the crime scene and dumped the body. The robot stopped working after that and stayed there for an unknown reason.=The candlestick that was the murder weapon was taken away from the crime scene and it's highly likely that the murderer has destroyed it. I'll have to let the police investigate this further.=The crime scene investigation is almost complete. I wonder if that little guest was <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Jenny</color>? I need to tell Royde to bring her in for questioning.=There's something suspicious about the robot too.

Don't waste time.=More liquid, he must have gone inside here.=This is controlled by an electronic valve, so I need to find the switch first.=There is no need to go back.=The door is locked and it can only be opened with a special key.=According to the map, this pipe should lead to a drainage outlet near the turbine. If this is turned on, it can provide some power for the turbine.=Looks like the water is running. I should check the turbine now.=There is no need to close it.=There's lots of progressively incomprehensible scribbles and scratches in the locker; from the look of it, whoever scrawled this text seems to have gradually lost their mind.=A very messy bed covered in blood stains.=It's full of rubbish ahead. Can't go any further.=A damp diary. Did it belong to that dead guy in the water?=Another diary? Does everyone keep their diary hidden in rubbish heaps now? And why am I constantly rooting through rubbish heaps? They stink.=There is so much rubbish and scattered parts, with barely room to move.=The water is flowing too fast now.=The garbage has been cleared out, there is no need to open the gate to release the water.=This person was stabbed to death. The corpse has swollen with water, and some parts are missing. The smell is awful.=I can’t force it open. Must be bolted shut from the other side.=Lots of maps of the underground sewage system. It seems quite complicated.=No point continuing. Unless I want to walk myself to death, which shouldn't take too long the way I'm going.=Construction plans for the hydroelectric power plant=Since there's a clue, let's look for the waterwheel operation manual first.=Hmm... The construction plans for the hydroelectric power plant district.=This blueprint shows that the turbine generators were constructed after the district had been completed.=Perfect! The operation manual for the water turbine.=To make the water turbine fully operational, there has to be sufficient power supplied to both the axis controller and the battery compartment.=There are lots of documents in the filing cabinet.=If the main power equipment goes offline, the back-up can be started to supply power to the generator. Attention: back-up engine requires an external power source, such as a battery.=To manually operate the impeller tilt shaft, use the back-up controller installed under the impeller. First make sure the battery is properly installed in the slot on the waterwheel, and that enough power is being supplied.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s bird face? This graffiti is very rough. It looks like it's been drawn in a hurry.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s symbol just keeps showing up during my investigation.=There are all kinds of wine in the cabinet.=There are all kinds of brandy in this cabinet.=There are all kinds of white wine in this cabinet.=Two-year old Cognac brandy.=Four-year old Cognac brandy.=More than eight years old Cognac brandy, with a graceful fragrance.=The door is locked tight. I'll need to find another way to get out.=This cabinet is locked. I need to find the key.=The clock has suddenly stopped.=Several ripped poker cards.=Darts scoreboard.=The password on the dartboard has been discovered. I should look for other clues.=Only the chosen one can remove the sword and be imbued with the ancient spirit contained within.=I can't pull it out. Am I not the chosen one?=A sword stuck in stone, waiting for the chosen one.=Making corpses of his victims into sculptures of an evil god, and leaving behind mysterious religious arrangements and grotesque ceremonies... These are all signature elements of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s old and extremely brutal crimes.=Yesterday's mysterious package led me to the Underbridge District, and now today's "sculpture" is pulling me back. Were these events all aimed at me? I'm almost convinced he has come back after all this time.=I just pray the gangs have left the crime scene untouched. If I'm right about this, <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> will have left me another message there.=Strange. I hallucinate whenever I touch the implanted devices.=But I only started to have hallucinations after I received that first package from <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>. How did he find out where I lived? Has Noa been spying on me all these years?=The hallucinations are becoming more and more clear, which can't be a good sign. If I ever come across another device, I need to be much more cautious.=Interesting. The robot parts are from different years...=But the human parts are all quite fresh. Less than a day old. The victims were probably all murdered last night.=While everything looks similar to the previous cases, the lack of attention to detail surprises me.=Has the murderer lost his skills, or is this actually a different individual? I hadn't considered we might be dealing with a copycat.=There's gotta be more clues here, and the presence of Brank's head is concerning. I better dig deeper.=This is a sculpture made of several human and robot bodies, very similar to those from a famous serial murder case many years ago. After some careful investigation, however, it's not hard to notice the differences between this and the older case, so it is quite likely an intentional camouflage.=It's set up to look like some sort of ritual. The murderer wanted to create a false worship site, but the footprints reveal his carelessness and lack of respect. This is nothing but a cover.=There are many candles on the outside, and a summoning circle was painted in the middle with human blood and robot supplementary liquid. The whole scene looks like a summoning ceremony.=A face made from a dead human and robot. The techniques are not quite as sophisticated as those of the cases thirteen years ago.=The torso skin is sewed onto an robot chest. The sewing skill is of a high level, but the result is still unpleasant.=The bones have been joined with a high degree of care, but the method used to connect torn muscle tissue seems a bit hurried.=A slotted alloy plate design used in the last machine generation, probably from a mid-age robot.=Upgraded not long ago, with the latest mechanical look that came out last month.=Some rust can be seen on the metal part.=Some kind of fungus, which may be a result of long term exposure to a dark and damp environment.=The livor mortis doesn't disappear under pressure, which indicates the time of death to be between four to ten hours ago.=The haze in the cornea suggests time of death to be between six and twelve hours ago.=Serial number R60X12W156ST1906 is visible under the eyes.=Brank's head has been taken apart to some degree.=So many "materials" used. Is this robot... Brank? Poor sod.=Robotic supplementary fluid that has coagulated.=There is a bloody footprint near the summoning ceremony set up, with no patterns. The owner must have worn shoe covers.=Fanatics believe that high-precision gold rings engraved with circuits can summon Bson's Hand.=The sewing of the joints and wounds seems a bit unstable. Is the murderer unpracticed after such a long break?=Judging from the variety of parts used, the murderer seems quite random in his selection of targets. It is not an easy task to "collect" this many robots, so there must have been multiple victims.=Apart from the rust on the robots, a kind of fungus can be seen on them too. This must be the result of long-time exposure to a dark and damp environment, which is very different from the previous sculpture cases.=From the look of this body, the time of death is before midnight, and it was not mutilated at the scene. Different to the old cases.=There are coagulated sediments on several parts of the supplementary fluid, which is similar to Brank's case. This suggests they were a result of the same method.=The footprints destroyed the integrity of the summoning circle. This suggests they didn't really care about the ceremony.=Let's take a look at the implanted device Charles talked about.=There is a device connected to the processing area of Brank's brain, and there is some white powder on the outside of the electronic brain.=The powdery deposits show signs of volatilization of the robot supplement.=The unpatterned footprints destroyed the integrity of the summoning circle.=Two halves of a gold bracelet, which is used for summoning.=Is that an invitation? Interesting.=It turns out Brank does have an implanted device in his head, so it seems <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> must be the one controlling robots.=There is a large amount of the same condensation found at the crime scene yesterday. I need to check with Charles about his research.=There should be more clues. Don't leave before completing the investigation.=Go back and finish your job, grandad. Or do you need to borrow my glasses to improve your eyesight?=The crime scene has mostly been figured out, but I'm still missing some key links. There are many traces of the same coagulated liquid from yesterday, so I'll need to ask Charles about it.=I've finished the investigation. But it's important that you allow me to ask some questions at the workshop over there.=Ugh... whatever. Be quick, I'll be waiting outside.=There are some light impressions which indicate that something the shape of a square was recently moved here, like some kind of box.=This is a ritual circle, which was arranged just like the ones in previous cases. There are candles still burning.=The shape of this box matches the mark below. Does that mean the murderer moved the bodies inside these cargo boxes? I should check the cargo passage.=The boxes used in the logistic hub are the same size, which is handy for tunnel transportation.=A box used in the logistics centre, which matches the marks below, so the murderer probably used boxes like this one to transport the bodies.=The murderer used a curtain to cover the sculpture, so no one would see him while he was putting the bodies together. Let's see what clues can be found on the curtain.=Wait, there's something behind the console...=He set a timer to lift the curtain at 8am today. He chose rush hour to reveal the sculpture to the public.=It looks like the murderer used this curtain to cover up the crime scene, ready for its big reveal.=There are logistic records at the workbench. The last record was left yesterday afternoon.=The last record was from yesterday afternoon, but the murderer couldn't have delivered the bodies at that time. The human corpses suggest they were killed last night. But wait... there's an encrypted file here.=The logistics records at the workbench have been altered, but that can't fool me.=The hook control station the murderer used to raise and lower the curtain.=There are no oil stains, so the fingerprints can't be collected.=The fingerprints are too blurry to be collected.=Fingerprints collected.=The finger print here has been collected.=Drag marks extend all the way to the elevator. I should follow them.=A weird clown mask is hanging here.=I recognise this mask! It's crime scene evidence from the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>AED Board of Directors Murder Case</color>, one the worst of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s crimes. If I remember correctly, 40 people on a cruise ship were killed.=Bunny puppet, poster, mask... Three pieces of evidence from three of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s cases. I wonder what else will be waiting for me ahead.=I need to find the right material to make the handprint.=Now I can use Charles' computer.=I'm sure I was the last person to touch this.=A messy workbench with all sorts of weird tools.=A two-level fluid storage unit that is filled with biological gel to simulate... "the environment of a placenta". Lovely.=A 3D printing station invented by Charles. Works pretty well, if you ask me!=Isn't this the "Laser Billy?" The old man is pretty good at creating weird tech.=My first priority is to examine the report on the coagulated liquid.=I've gathered enough clues. Time to organize the case before I leave.=The analysis report of the supplementary fluid should be in the computer, so we need to figure out a way to crack Charles' identification lock.=A tipped over coffee mug, and the coffee grounds have solidified.=#N/A:133030103=The fingerprints on this switch are incomplete, so it's not much use.=Don't enter a girl's room without asking!=Even if Charles' fingerprints are on the door knob, they are probably covered by Lola's prints.=There are all kinds of tools and strange inventions.=A gun storage box. From the look of the shape, the gun is a Chiappa Rhino 20DS, 38 calibre, 165mm long, 700g weight and good for self-defence.=The murderer made use of the special logistics hubs in Underbridge, and used standard shipping containers to transport the materials. After that, he used the curtains to cover his sculpture.=Although the murderer tried very hard to imitate the previous M.O., the details weren't copied perfectly.=The murderer set up a timing device on the hook control station after he finished the sculpture, then left the scene.=From the evidence in the workshop, Charles left the workshop after this, and has been missing since.=The timing device went off in the morning and the curtain was raised, revealing the sculpture to the public and causing quite a shock.=Charles must have left some trace on the code keys. Hopefully his fingerprints are still there.=At last! Got it.=This is where Charles worked, so there might be fingerprints. Let's do a scan.=Great! The fingerprints are pretty clear.=A coffee cup tipped over from last night, which should have Charles' hand print on it.=The finger print is clearer than I expected from an old man. Charles must have been careful about hand care. The machine oil residue left in the hand print matches Charles' working habits.=This finger print can be used as a sample to compare Charles' finger prints from other parts of the room.=<color%3D#afafafff>萝拉提到的枪盒，门锁开关和工作台都可以注意一下。</color>=Charles' fingerprints should be on the gun box. I'll take a scan.=Charles' fingerprints are on the box latch, so he did take the gun last night.=#N/A:133030109=An essay published in Naturely by Doc Edward, which talks about Nano robots implementation.=This is a famous magazine in the scientific world, as far as I know, so Doc Edward must be an expert in this field.=Naturely=Vol.35 No.2=Research progress into the mechanism and implementation of Nano robots=Dr. Edward Amber=Summary: A statement of the research progress into the operational mechanism and activity maintenance of Nano robots.

It should be nearby, judging from the distance I've travelled.=From the look of the traces, the individual must have entered through this door. But it's shut tight now.=I remember seeing an unusual red gate switch back in <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Diamond Square</color>. It should be nearby, judging from the distance I've travelled.=The traces seem to lead through this door. I should take a closer look.=The switch to the water gate has been damaged. Could Brank have done it? A technician like him wouldn't have to use this much brute force.=This kind of power supply can only conduct energy when the sources are arranged in order from weakest to strongest.=All I need to do is beat you in a game of cards? You must really want to give me this information.=I've collected the herb, so now I just need to follow the recipe.=Huh? An unread message?=I’ll need to unlock each rod in order. I need to figure out the sequence.=These circuits are a mess, no wonder it's malfunctioning. If I can connect them correctly, we should be back in business.=An antique spring lock system. This takes me back! I need to push each of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the locks</color> back <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>into place</color> to open it.=This device can adjust the direction of the signals by using the prism, but it needs one more module to work.=Looks like someone installed this incorrectly. The light beam needs to be adjusted so that the signal reaches both ports. Placing the prisms correctly should help.=Cut along the edge while maintaining a stable temperature.=Why is Brank using this kind of lock at his place?=Entered successfully. If the electronic modules are moved into place, we can read Brank's little secrets.=At least five signal lights should stay green at the same time.="Be sure of how many points you would like to win before you do anything." This looks like a very important clue.=The three pointers are the same length. Does this mean they can be set to a random order?

I have prepared something... fabulous for you.=This is the staff access to the cellar.=This is the staff area of the bar. Why would I serve myself when the waiter is doing such a good job already?=This must be the wine cellar that person mentioned earlier. Should I take a look around? <color%3D#F39800FF>[Side Task]</color>=Enter the wine cellar.=No, thanks.=Most of these legends are false. There is no need to waste time.=Why did you come from the cellar? Only employees are allowed down there.=You're not supposed to be here. Don't even try to steal the alcohol.=This is the lounge of the bar staff, and I am not interested at all.=What a scary place! Hopefully I can find something interesting.=I heard a switch clicking. Did it work?=A bizarre cross stich, from long ago.=What an interesting monkey mask. Judging by the design it must have a secret compartment.=It's too dark down here. What's that flashing thing?=The statue of the renowned Dr. Wonder Tales. I've been hearing of his stories since I was little.=After the instructions were entered, the whole liquid tank activated. Did the instructions activate the liquid inside?=This equipment seems to be sending out instructions through the movements of the fluid. What is it calling for?=These seem to be sequence codes for robots, along with some other data of unknown significance. Is it a sample of the experiment?=I just saw Brank's sequence code. It seems that he's one of the experimental samples.=The equipment's interface was damaged, and the cabin shows traces of robot paint where they scratched against the surface. This capsule warehouse was last used by robots, and treated quite roughly by the looks of things.=This is... It seems that the liquid leaked from the damaged interface is the same as the residue left by Brank, but it's still in its original form. I should take some samples.=Robot joints, bones, nerves, muscle fibers... but no complete limbs. Are these the remains of some robot dissection?=This residue is different from the one Brank left behind. Is that because of differences within the robots themselves?=Why did all traces of Brank suddenly stop here?=This is the same mark as the one left by Brank earlier. He must have been here.=There must be a lot of clues here. I should investigate carefully.=Someone has used this device to activate the liquid, controlling the robots and forcing them to come here like walking corpses.=This gigantic device must be the key to why robots were attracted to this place, and the method for controlling the robots must be this liquid. I need to give this sample to Charles for an analysis.=However, Brank's trail ends here. Was he taken somewhere else? There's no hidden switch here. I need to keep looking.=What the... Storing such a large amount of recharge fluid is a big project. There must be something huge connected to this machine.=Looks like this robot is dead. Let me check inside the head casing... Yes, he has the same device installed as the others! Looks like this one's broken, though.=This strange liquid seems... alive, and it's entering the electronic brain through the implanted device.

Maybe you’ve already heard about it.=Some people are terrified because they saw some strange shadows moving near the entrance of the sewers, but I didn't see anything when I went there.=They say that there are paranormal beings there.=Have you decided who you're gonna vote for yet?=The election? Since when were you interested in that?=Because one of the candidates is a robot this time!=I'll be voting for a human either way.=I don't think robots stand a chance this time, because "you know who" is also running for the election.=Nothing much. I'm just taking a look.=I know every piece of gossip in this neighborhood.=The police came earlier and took the homeless guy away. God knows what happened.=I don't really know either.=A lot of things have been going on lately. I heard some robots say that several robots have gone missing recently.=Maybe I should relocate my shop.=B-Beer... Is sho delicioush...=Y-You want a-a beer too? Itsh my treat!=If it isn't Chris. Where’d you get enough money to buy beer? Actually, never mind. It’s probably better if I don’t know. Just try not waste it all, okay?=Why is it taking so long?=Woof~ Woof~=Are you hurting again, Cheese? Take this pain killer, I promise that you'll be released from this body very soon.=Why is it taking so long? Cheese's suffering increases with every second he waits!=What took you so long!? Do you know how much pain my Cheese has been going through?=Keep quiet! They are cracking down on consciousness copies lately. But look, if you're serious about saving your dog, then I have a way. Instead of copying it, why don't you clone it? Cloning won't cost too much, either. Besides, it is so much better to have a fluffy pup in your hand than a cold hard data file.=Look, I've done my research. Cloning can't copy the original character and memory. So no, I don't want a clone. I want my Cheese, with all his character and love for me.=You have to know that copying consciousness doesn't mean...=No! Stop this nonsense. If you copy the consciousness, he will stay with me for ever, and he can be free of the pain he is in now.=Well, if you insist. My contact will be here in a few minutes. So I'll need my fixer fee right now. This has cost me a lot of time, you know.=Money is not a problem, Anything for my Cheese.=My Cheese will soon be free from pain. He will always be with me... my Cheese...=You can fish for all sorts of things in this river, which can be sold for a good price after they are cleaned.=Shush! Be quiet! You're scaring off my "harvest".=I wish I could see what Sky City is like. I heard that everyone is carefree there. Oh hello hot stuff. Do you want to come be carefree with me? Hehe...=Hey, uncle, do you want to visit my home before we go to Sky City? Hehe...=Meow~=William! You're back so soon? What have you got there?=Are you hurt? I don't see any wounds though...=Meow! Meow! Meow!=The little guy is so anxious. Something must have happened.=Since I can't do anything else for BB-X right now, I should probably follow William and take a look.=Well done, William! How did you find that murder weapon?=Meow~ Meow~ Meooow~=<color%3D#afafafff>William dances excitedly as he explains what happened. It seems that he had quite an adventure!</color>=Well, well. So someone had an adventure. It's too bad that I can't understand you.=Either way, I need to thank you for retrieving the murder weapon! Here, have some dried fish.=It's getting late and I still need to ask the old man in the repair shop about that implant device and take a taxi to the bar.=It looks like William wants me to go into the alley with him.=I'll go there now.=Not yet.=Royde, I believe there is something unusual about that robot. If we give up now, we'll lose critical evidence.=I'm sorry Rex. You know that after the Specials take over my hands are tied.=The SMS is such a pain, now I'm no longer on the inner circle. Can you get me a picture of that implanted device? I didn't have a chance to take one just then.=It won't be easy, but I'll try. You were acting a little unusual just then. Did something happen?=Well, I'm not quite sure either. Now that I think about it, maybe something on that robot affected me.=I see. It seems like there's more than meets the eye here. But let’s talk about that later tonight. There’s a good bar I know.=Alright. I need to ask someone about the implanted device first.=I need to head back to the station now. I’ll send you the address of that bar I mentioned.=Okay, see you later.=You haven't completed the Boss's task, so you can't go there yet.=You can leave now that you've done your job. Meow!=Meow~ Who are you? Why are you here?=#N/A:200035001=Paulie?=Did the Boss send you here?=I'm just here to run a test, relax.=Hmph.=[Do you want to test Paulie?]=Test.=Don't test.=Let's begin the test. Please take a look at this unicorn...=It looks like there's nothing wrong with Paulie.=You've passed the test. Thank you for your cooperation.=What is that test for? What does the Boss want?=It looks like you didn't say anything inappropriate in front of The Boss. Well done, I owe you one.=#N/A:200035301=#N/A:210035302=You've got some skills to see through my disguise.=Nobody can hurt Don Vito when I'm around.=Meow! Kid, leave me alone!=I need to run a quick test on you. Just relax and tell me how you feel when you see this...=Don't you trick me.=[Do you want to test Bradsey?]=Test.=Don't test.=Let's begin the test. Please take a look at this unicorn...=<color%3D#afafafff>[Did the Boss react to the unicorn just now?]</color>=What are you doing? Are you playing a prank on me?=No, I've completed my test. Thanks for your cooperation.=<color%3D#afafafff>[Bradsey reacted normally, but the Boss's reaction was... somewhat unusual.]</color>=I've got my eye on you, kid!=Meow, hold it right there! Who do you think you are, just waltzing in here like that?=It's okay, Bradsey.=Let’s not scare our little friend here.=Meow... Sorry, Boss. I was just worried that...=There's no need for concern. In fact, he might have arrived at precisely the right time. The Bourbon family could use a cat like him.=You must be William. I've heard about you.=Most honorable Don Vito, please permit me to enter the biocats' territory.=You know how to respect your elders. This virtue is rare among the younger generations.=This is a turbulent time for our family and its territory, so I have declared a state of martial law. No cat may pass other than the cats of our family.=The good news for you is that I require some assistance with a very important task. If you agree to do it for me, you will have my blessing to travel as you please.=I guess I don’t have a choice.=I don’t have much time.=The Godfather has given me an offer I can't refuse!=Each cat has their own destiny. Now that you are here, make the most of it.=Well, Don Vito, what can I do for you?=I might not have enough time for it.=I understand that all too well. Relax, this task isn't complicated and isn't anything dodgy either.=Please tell me then. What is this task?=A biocat has infiltrated our family and leaked information about our family to our enemies. I need you to root him out for me.=Do you have any suspects?=Hmm, (coughing) speak to my counselor, Martin, about the details. He knows all about these biocats.=Alright, I got it. It looks like you should get some rest.=Report to him whenever you find any clues (coughing). You can trust him fully on this matter. Complete this task and you will be a friend to the Bourbon family.=Let your friends underestimate your strengths and your foes overestimate your weaknesses.=William, you are a great friend to the Bourbon Family.=If possible, I 'd like to run a test on you too.=Me? Well, I guess that's okay. You reminded me of something.=Please relax and enjoy the experience.=Well, I was thinking of...=You idiot, what have you done to the Boss?=Calm down, Bradsey! He wasn't going to hurt me.=Yes, Boss.=I'm sorry, even a sophisticated cat like you can't control your behavior when you see the foil unicorn. This is a unique flaw shared by first generation biocats.=Is that so... Well that explains a lot.=Meow~ Boss, don't listen to his bullshit. I'll rip him apart!=Stop, Bradsey! Do you want me to lose all my credibility?=William, you have accomplished your task successfully, even if it has put me in a rather difficult position.=As promised, you have gained the friendship of the Bourbon family. As for me... I have to deal with some unfinished business.=Boss, I will follow you no matter what happens.=None of the test subjects reacted to the tinfoil, so it seems that none of them are biocats. But what was with the Boss's weird reaction just then?=I'd better report this to Martin first.=A real biocat will definitely fail this test. It's time to find some test subjects!=<color%3D#afafafff>[The Boss’s reaction was a bit strange. Should I test him again?]</color>=[Do you want to test the Boss himself?]=Test.=Don't test.=<color%3D#afafafff>Don't act rashly; it's best to discuss this with Martin first.</color>=Father grounded me because of the matter concerning the Fitcher family and I'm so bored, meow. Sweetheart, do you want to have some fun?=Well actually... I’m kind of busy right now...=What’s the rush? Surely you can spare a few moments to play the piano for me?=Well...=You're more talented than I thought. I like you.=Meow~ I'm all by myself again...=Come on, follow my steps. Meow~=Very good! Looks like I need to make it harder for you. Listen up closely.=Very impressive! I like your performance, this little ball is for you.=William, is this your girlfriend? Judging from her fur, she seems to be a rare breed. Good choice, William!=Meow~ Meow~=Did you understand what I said? Wait... is that blood on you? Let me see where you're hurt!=Weird, I don't see any wounds.=The marks lead all the way to this dumpster.=Hey there, little fatty. It's time to wake up!=Zzz... Zzz... Meow~=He's sleeping too soundly. I need something to distract him.=Stay where you are and put your hands in the air!=I’ve got you covered, Rex. Move up and check it out.=Just like the good old days...=Relax, Royde. He's in hibernation mode.=That thing scared the hell out of me. I almost shot it!=Wait, what's that on the couch?=It's <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>blood</color>! Rex, take a look at this.=Did you say blood? There's also blood on the hands and feet of this robot.=Robots are unable to harm humans, so what’s with all the blood? Let's check out the couch.=How is the investigation going?=We're pretty much done here. Contact Royde and examine the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>next room</color>.=Hey, Royde, we're done with the investigation here. Let's check the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>next room</color>.=You can continue with the rest of the investigation. Karl told me they caught a suspect, so I better take a look.=A suspect? Sure, I'll come over when I finish here.=Rex, what are you doing? Go see what that <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>robot</color> is up to! I'll cover you!=There are dried blood stains on the front and back of the couch. These blood stains appear to be an attempt to clean up blood splatter.=This is Mrs. Perry's blood, and it looks like a full 24 hours since the blood dried up. It's likely that Mrs. Perry was killed at about 12 o'clock yesterday.=Also, judging from the trajectory of the blood splash, it was an upward strike with the swing starting at a low angle.=Let's assume this is the primary crime scene. I'll organize all the information we have so far. Meanwhile, let me know if you find something else.=Huh? Elizabeth? Why are you at my place? Where is William?=Meow~=Why didn't you go downstairs, Elizabeth?=Meow, hmmm, Meow~~=William! You’ve got some explaining to do, pal. And who is that new white cat? You switched girlfriends already?=I didn't know you were so popular. No wonder Elizabeth doesn't want to come downstairs.=This new white cat seems very attached to William.=How did you get here? Don't run around and destroy the scene.=Meow~meow~=There he is!=Hey, you little punk! That’s my wallet you stole!=Oh no, he's coming! Talk later, Abir!=You fool, catch me if you can!=He wanted me to follow him into the alley. It’s obviously a trap. I have to figure something else out.=That kid is always the same...=He’s not a bad kid, really. He just had a tough childhood growing up with no family except for his sister. I guess old habits die hard.=But, well... I hope someone can finally teach him a lesson.=Hey there, stranger. You look a little depressed. Can we help in any way?=I’m busy right now, old timer. My wallet and pass just got pickpocketed by some kid. I don’t suppose you know where that alley leads to?=A kid? Are you talking about a child dressed in red, about 7 or 8 years old?=Not again! Why won’t he listen to me? Don’t worry, I can help you get your stuff back.=The kid’s name is Robin. He just likes fooling around and causing a ruckus. Lola will get your stolen items back, don’t you worry.=Say, you DO have an interesting physical structure, don’t you. What do you say to a free physical checkup, as an apology for what Robin did?=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Charles' Workshop</color>? You must be the guy Morax asked me to see. I should’ve known, you both seem to share an interest in my cyber augmentations.=Are you crazy? Don’t compare me to that amateur, I’m nothing like him! But I have to say...your body structure...it’s fascinating...=Nothing like Morax, eh? Whatever you say, old timer. Anyway, the reason I’m here is to show you this...=Hmmm, what's this? Wires directly connected to the internal core of the electronic brain... I see... Well, this is something quite unusual.=Hmm, at first glance it looks like the basic method used by traffickers to control robots. They use this technique to destroy any evidence if the robot is captured or rescued.=I know what you’re talking about. They use it to burn the electronic brain. But that’s not what happened here. The brain was intact.=But that would mean...perhaps someone has found a way to crack the electronic brain? I’d call that a miracle!=This electronic brain is pretty old though. The last time I saw one like this...wait a second...=That’s right...some guy came through here about a month ago. He also had an unusual device on his electronic brain, with that very same symbol!=Are you sure?=Yeah, I’m sure. Even the date on his brain was quite close. But his external device was more complex.=Do you still have the records?=You think I keep records of everyone who comes to me? All I remember is his name: <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Brank</color>. And...something about the big boobies on Miracle Street...=Um...I mean the holographic tour guide...what’s her name...Flower Tune? <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Brank</color> is her maintenance mechanic. You should try to speak with him. He might know more about that device.=Were you just chasing that little boy in the red clothes?=Damn right, I was! The little punk stole my wallet and disappeared into the alley.=Ugh, he was stealing again? Don't worry, I'll help you get your stuff back.=This... What happened?=Try to relax, young man. Lola will get your belongings for you. Why don't you sit down and allow me to give you an examination, on the house?=You can detect my augments? Hang on... Charles Workshop... I guess that makes you <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Charles</color>?=Indeed I am. Charles, a downtrodden mechanic in Underbridge at your service. It seems you know of me.=Morax sent me to find you. Maybe you can help.=Let me take a look. A device directly connected to the quantum brain? The craft is pretty complicated, no wonder that young man asked you to find me.=Eh? This thing is equipped with an anti-analysis mechanism which will destroy the interior hardware if opened. This is what I like to call a challenge... Wait, give me a minute, actually I may have seen something like this recently...=I serviced a robot not long ago, and there was an external device like this one jacked into his electronic brain.=Was it a robot from Underbridge District?=Right, I remember now. It was <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Brank from the Bellflower House</color>. Yes, and Dr. Edward asked me to help identify the device. I noticed that this thing was in hibernation mode and that irreversible damage could be done if it was tampered with, so I left it intact.=It seems that a lot of people are looking for Brank recently. Now that's a robot with a story.=Where can I find Brank?=It's probably best to ask about Brank on <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Miracle Street</color>. He's the maintenance technician for the big boobies, eh... I mean the virtual tour guide <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Kanon</color>. The people over there should be able to help.=By the way, if you happen to see my grandson, it's worth asking him about it too. Recently he's taken an interest in the robots that have been disappearing lately. His name is <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Nanco</color>. He's a little robot, and a budding detective too.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Nanco</color>? Sure, I'll ask him.=Come back to me if you've got any physical problems. Better than going to that Morax fellow. He's barely out of diapers!=The water supply is cut off, you can’t pass this way.=Is there anyone working on this?=The maintenance guy is nowhere to be found. Someone has gone to find him.=Can I have a look? Maybe I can help.=Knock yourself out. Just don’t try any funny stuff, I’ll be watching you.=It worked! Now the entire device should be operational.=What? You fixed it? Well, I guess now we can call it a day. Good times at Miracle Street await!=I’m not a guy you wanna mess with. If you can’t fix the water supply, get out of my way.=The plumber disappeared last month, and nobody can find Brank, the other handyman.=Maybe the old man from the workshop can help?=Hey, you in the coat. You've been staring at it for long enough. Can you help fix the water main?=Help repair the water system? <color%3D#F39800FF>[Side Task]</color>=No.=Maybe I can give it a try.=I can't do it.=Then quit messing around here!=Maybe I can try, but I need to look at what’s wrong before I can be sure.=Then come over here and check it out.=Just don't screw up!=You can't go through until the water supply is fixed.=How can I help?=Can I borrow the electroplating machine?=Well, yes, but with a condition.=I miss Hideyoshi so much and she is in <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Night Flower Town</color>. I can't go see her right now because of work, so can you please hand this letter over to her?=Hmm, should I deliver the letter?=No problem.=I’m busy right now.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Night Flower Town</color>?=I'm too busy to deliver a letter at the moment.=Yeah, it’s a bit further down Miracle Street. Hideyoshi works at the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Maid Café</color>.=I’m headed to Miracle Street anyway. I’ll see if I can drop it off for you.=I'll electroplate your thing now. Hand it over.=You're still here?=Hey, are you slacking? Need me to help massage your tired muscles and bones, eh?=Mario, you do know that two days from now is Grace Day, Underbridge's most solemn festival? What my partner here is trying to ask is, what are we gonna do if the statue isn't fixed in time?=D- don't worry, I- I'm on it. It'll be finished today.=I certainly hope so, because we both know how much I'd enjoy kneading your back with my fists.=Mario, the dignity of the King is in your hands. Just try and fix that statue on time.=Thanks to this job I haven't seen my dear Hideyoshi in quite a while. My mind is wandering and it's difficult to concentrate.=My darling Hideyoshi... without you my life is no fun at all.=Huh? Who are you? Forget it. Whoever you are, can you do me a favor?=I need to finish restoring the King's statue before Grace Day, so I haven't had time to visit Hideyoshi. It's driving me crazy!=Can you pass this note to Hideyoshi for me? It's a love letter, all my feelings are written out on this page.=Should I help Mario? <color%3D#F39800FF>[Side Task]</color>=Agree=Refuse.=Let's see the address... Night Flower Town? I'm not familiar with it.=Hideyoshi works in a maid café there. It shouldn't be hard to find.=I'm entrusting you with this important mission!=Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you with that.=I see. If you change your mind... I'll be here.=Sparks are flying everywhere. This guy is busy, I won’t bother him.=Sir, are you here for a physical check-up?=No, I'm just looking.=I will serve my patients to the best of my ability, using my knowledge and judgement to get to the cause of any problem.=Are you here to see a doctor?=Actually, I’m just here to check if you dealt with a patient named <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Brank</color>?=Yes, but he checked out already. How can I help?=Is it possible for me to check the diagnosis report?=Certainly not! Patient-doctor confidentiality means I can’t share that with you.=<color%3D#afafafff>[It seems I need to distract the doctor if I want to see the report]</color>=Hey, Doc, somebody up above might need your help.=What is it?=A robot seems to have passed out up in C-1 District. Any chance you can check it out?=A robot? Okay, I'm on my way.=Luna, you look after things here. I need to step out for a while...=After the accident, Edward and I have drifted apart. So...=Hi, there. Just before the Doc ran out, he was about to show me that robot's diagnosis report. I’m a close personal friend of his, you see. Some might say we’re like family. Actually, that’s it. We’re family!=Sorry, according to hospital regulations, we can't reveal any information if the patient is not here in person.=<color%3D#afafafff>[The doctor is gone, so if I can distract the nurse, I should be able to sneak a peek at Brank's diagnosis. I know this is a pretty dirty move, even for me, but I’m running out of time.]</color>=If Edward is not here, what can I do when a patient comes in?=Please don't bother the patients!=He seems to be in a deep sleep, and he's really struggling to breathe.=Maybe I can get the nurse’s attention with this patient beeper.=What is it?=The nurse is distracted. Now's my chance...=Meow, meow, meow~~~=I knew you were following me! <color%3D#afafafff>He seems a bit on edge. Is there something inside there?</color>=You're very sensitive to things like this. Are you really just a cat?=This is where the traces last appear. There's a secret passage ahead, I smell a conspiracy!=Hey, you! What are you up to?=I didn't expect such a thing to happen to Brank. Fortunately you weren't hurt.=Thanks. Do you have any clues about these Nano bots?=I've never actually seen them before. It's said they're only used in a few exotic treatments. Maybe the King has something to do with them?=The gangs are up to something. When I tracked down the transit station earlier, there was an explosion. They must have been behind it.=An explosion? I hope the clinic is okay. I wonder if that's why Luna keeps calling me.=Was the explosion near the clinic? You should go back and check it out.=I'm on my way. We can talk later.=Ha! Look at me, Edward. I'm an old man. Robots from the old days were much less complicated.=I'm sure the same principles apply. How did you adjust a robot's ability to decelerate back then?=Have you tried tinkering with the PID parameter? Normally that does the job.=Oh, I didn't know that.=You've got a visitor, I'll come back later.=Nanco lent me this door card earlier. It's very convenient. I hear it was your invention.=Oh, this is just the prototype. I've since developed a new Heaven-Level passcard. The gangsters' pass card systems won't stop an old man like me for long!=Pretty impressive work, I must say. You have so many inventions.=Of course I do! The Soul Separator and Laser Billy are two of my personal favorites.=I don't suppose you have any core processor chips for an old robot laying around? My friend has been... well... out of action lately.=It is nearly impossible to find parts for those antique robots now, but my "God's Touch" device should work on even the most ancient androids.=Looks like you have all the necessary parts to put it together. Now all you need to do is to print one out according to the blueprint.=Looks like you are missing some parts, but I have one here that you can have.=I will start researching the supplement you gave me later. Don't worry, I'll have the results tomorrow.=Why are you three here? What are you talking about?=We are talking about the explosion at the big water wheel earlier.=Oh, er, was there an explosion?=You don't look surprised at all. Are you in anyway involved?=What, did you blow it up!? Wow...=No, no, I was searching for Brank. His trail was erratic, like someone else was operating his limbs. It led me to a  place with recharging bays and a tank of some strange Nano fluid. This fluid could be what was controlling him. And then seconds later, boom. I barely escaped.=Recharging bays, Nano fluid... I have a feeling this has something to do with the missing robot cases.=And the robots were being controlled... That possibility never crossed my mind.=Cool! The gangsters must be conducting secret experiments!=I am not sure whether there is anything to do with the gangs, but the explosion happened when I was about to find out more.=If you didn't see anyone coming after you, it is likely to be an automatically triggered self-destruction device.=I think you're right. The explosion ruined almost all the evidence, but I was lucky enough to have collected some samples of the Nano fluid before that. Charles is looking into it now.=This is much more complicated than we thought it was at first. The three of us will keep collecting information. If we find anything, I will let you know tomorrow.=Good luck, but be careful. I don't want to rescue two miscreant kids and a robot that thinks it's a real detective.=Sorry again for stealing your wallet earlier. Let's shake hands and let bygones be bygones or whatever you old folks say.=I saw that, Robin! Give the man his watch back this instant!=Is Brank actually in danger? I'll try to collect some more information. Let's talk tomorrow!=That freak sculpture is right over there. You're free to look around, but don't do anything stupid. We're watching you.=Thanks for your kind words of support. Stay out of the way while I'm investigating, and do not disturb the crime scene.=If you want, we can trade insults all day. I have a memory bank full of them. Or you could stop whining and do your job.=I didn't expect you guys to be here. Where’s Charles?=Grandpa... he's gone missing!=Missing? What do you mean?=Follow me and I'll explain. Robin, stay here and keep an eye out for any gang members.=Yeah, that's a cool job. Leave it to me!=Grandpa left suddenly, and he took his gun... I hope he's not in any danger.=I wonder where Charles went to...=Nothing to report, sir! Except... well, here's your ring back. I took it when you walked by me just now. Please don't tell Lola!=The coffee cup has been tipped over. Charles seems to have left in a hurry.=Grandpa keeps a gun box hidden under his pillow. I checked it and it's empty. He must have taken the gun with him.=If he armed himself, then he must have had some idea about where he was going. Could it be related to the Nano fluid research from yesterday?=Grandpa stayed up quite late last night. I was too tired so I went to bed before him. I could tell something was wrong, but I didn't ask. I assumed he was worried about his research.=I see. I should take a closer look at what he was doing.=The report is in grandpa’s computer. Take a look yourself.=掌纹解锁？那倒有些麻烦了。=工坊里有材料，可以用3D打印台做一个爷爷的手模，但是掌纹数据必须重新提取。=这个咖啡杯上应该可以提取查尔斯的指纹，用这个做参照对比，再收集其他信息吧。=Let's have a look at the research report first.=These Nano bots can break through the defenses of an electronic brain? If that’s true...=What? But that can't happen! If this is correct, then people would go crazy. Nobody would trust robots ever again!=So we have two ways in which Nano fluid is connected to today's crime scene. Brank was full of the stuff, and there's residue under the statue too.=But let's take one step at a time. Gather the evidence, then fit it together.=This is...=That's grandpa's weapon box. I don't know how he can get a good night's sleep with that thing poking him in the side of the head.=If Charles left with a gun, it means he sensed danger. The box was neatly put back in its place though, which suggests he had enough time to prepare.=The sculpture in the square must have been done by someone under <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s instruction, or someone with knowledge of his previous crimes. From the residue left behind on the square, today's murder and yesterday's investigation are linked!=Judging from the condensate left carelessly at the sculpture site, the murderer must have something to do with my investigation yesterday. They're probably trying to interfere with us.=Charles may have guessed the identity of the murderer by analyzing the condensate before he disappeared, but why would he go out in the middle of the night with a gun? Where did he go?=Apart from us, the only one who knew we were going to analyze the residue was Doc Edward.=When he heard about the explosion yesterday, he was really shocked. We should go see him next.=As a matter of fact, we have already tried to reach Dr. Edward today.=Ah, perfect. You're all still here.=Nanco? You're back already? Did the gang get tough with you?=Pah, Nanco doesn't get caught. But sadly, there wasn't much I could do. The gang has locked the clinic down.=I don't know the exact connection between the doctor and Grandpa's disappearance, but I can no longer state that there isn't one.=Tell uncle Rex the results of our investigation.=Yesterday we searched the site of the explosion very carefully, but everything was ruined. The gang sealed off the area right after we left.=And today, there was no sign of the good doctor at his clinic. The whole area was swarming with thugs.=So Doc Edward and Charles both go missing at the same time... This can't be a simple coincidence.=The hallucination I experienced near the sculpture was clearly aimed at me.=From the look of things, the kidnapping of robots and resulting sculpture may have been committed by the same person, or group of people. However the gangsters seem to have been caught off guard.=We can't carry out an inspection of the clinic if the gangs are already in residence. So let's focus on the logistics hubs instead. If we start there, we might find where the sculpture... materials... came from.=But we don't know if the clues are red herrings or not.=Trust me, if this is who I think it is... then it's all part of his fun. Keep watch on the clinic for now, I'll go check out the logistics hubs.=Who are you talking about? You're not saying that the one behind all this is... <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>?=Looks like you're pretty well informed. Whoever it is, I'll make this nutcase pay for what he's done.=So, kids. I'll need your help to distract the guard outside. Any ideas how to do it?=Leave that to me!=You?=Nanco and Robin can distract the guard using grandpa's imitation device, and I'll get you to the logistics hub.=Wait, what? I didn't agree to this!=You talk about kicking gangster butt every day! Now's your chance.=Sure... but why have I gotta help this loser?=Oh?=Okay, okay! But only because Charles needs my help.=I guess this is it. Let's get ready to move out.=Are you ready to go out?=Wait a minute.=Ready.=Give me a minute.=Let's go. Everyone needs to be careful, those gangsters won't go easy on you just because you're kids.=Relax, we know our way around.=Follow the delivery tubes, and you should be able to find the next logistics hub. The gangs are on high alert today, so you need to be extra careful.=Take this. It is a location positioning badge grandpa and I designed together. He should be wearing his badge right now. When two badges get close enough, they send out a signal that gets stronger as the badges grow closer.=Good luck. I hope you can find grandpa. Now I've got to get back to Robin. He's such a bull-headed dimwit, he's probably mouthing off to a guard pretending to be you this instant!=Ha, he's keeping up my reputation then! But be careful, Lola. Those gangs won't give you special treatment just because you’re a child.=Sure enough everything passes through here, but they seem to have come from way down there.=Phone ringing=It’s me. How is it going in there?=Hmmm, it seems the crate originated from a further hub, so I'll need to look deeper.=The gangs strictly control the pathways down there, it's how they carry out smuggling and other illegal operations. It'll be very dangerous without a guide.=Did someone call for a guide? Leave that to me! I can be your holographic GPS!=BB-X?! How did you...=I have access to your communications channel. You're surprised I can hack into your phone calls?=…I guess that makes sense. Remind me to cut off your access later!=That should help with navigation. Still, be careful down there.=Not a problem. The path you talked about...I think I was there yesterday, but it was well guarded.=The murder case has disrupted the gang too. They've sent search groups everywhere, which might cause gaps in their security.=I guess I'll find out sooner or later. Thanks for the help.=There seems to be no guards around here today. I will go have a look first.=Well well, if it isn't the famous detective...=Why are you here? Are you selling information again?=Well, you know that the times are tough right now...=Since you're here, have you got anything interesting for me?=I've always got something interesting. It just might not be interesting to you.=Actually, now that you mention it, I do have something related to that incident that happened ten years ago. You might be interested in that.=It isn't anything important and I'm not even sure if it's true. Let's treat it like a rumor.=What do you want in return?=Let's play a game of cards. I'll tell you if you win.=Play a game of cards with Mr. Know-It-All?=Let's do it.=No, thanks.=I'm not interested in your information.=Well, you can always come to me if you change your mind.=Sounds fair.=The underground has had some rather active robots lately. Rumor has it that they're looking for the key to how the Revolutionists managed to bypass the source code ten years ago.=That's all I know. Do you want to buy me a drink or play a few more games with me?=Let's play.=No thanks.=Hmmm, wanna try again?=Let's do it.=No, thanks.=I don't have any customers at all because of the murder yesterday! Such bad luck!=A customer complained to me last time because of the cats, and now this happened... My goodness...=You know what? This Sophora Apartments seems to be haunted because strange things happened there before as well.=The stray cats have left, which might be a good thing. I hope they never return.=What do you want to chat about?=The missing robot.=The murder.=Nothing much.=It seems like Alex is going to win the election for sure.=Why is that?=The missing robots have stirred up such controversy that no one wants to vote for Amos Agusto in case they get in trouble.=Goodness me, Mrs. Perry was killed.=I heard the murderer was a robot, a robot steward of a high-ranking official. I knew these robots were nothing but trouble!=I also heard that a little girl witnessed everything! Poor girl, she must be having nightmares.=Nothing much. I'm just taking a look.=It's so chaotic these days!=The things I fish out are always covered in a purple sticky fluid that is very hard to wash off.=Look, there is still some left on my finger. I wonder where it's from.=Do you know if this thing is bad for my health? Do I need find a different fishing spot?=Look at how happy my little Cheese is now. He will not suffer from any pain in this little digital world, and he will get all he wants.=[A little puppy that looks like Cheese plays happily in the screen.]=But, why... Why do I feel so miserable inside...=Although I can't pat his head again, we will be together forever.=I heard that if I go to Sky City, I will never get sick again. If only I could afford it...=I heard that if I go to Sky City, I will never get sick again. If only I could afford it...=One, two, one two... Watch out, Melete! Behind you!=Focus! Long Hair Princess 428! Don't pass out like last time.=Keep on dancing! Just like this! Everyone move on with me!=Good! Just like that! Charge with me!!!=I probably won't see Robert again, but whenever there is a kite in the sky, I think of the friendship between us.=I heard something horrible from the Society. Poor Mrs. Perry. We used to go to the anti-robot parade together and she was the kindest person in the anti-robot Society. I can't believed she was killed by a robot.=You are not allowed to associate with these dangerous robots any more, Arnold!=Why does grandma hate robots so much? He is my friend.=I need to move away from this neighborhood full of robots.=Arnold said he is leaving and I hope he likes my kite.=I want to fly a kite with Arnold one more time.=It's you again. Did you finally decide to become my test subject?=I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that. I came to ask for your opinion on this piece of tech. Does it look familiar?=What is this? Is it a device that improves computing ability? Which robot's electronic brain did you cut open to get this?=It is against the law to install external devices on electronic brains.=Was this device connected to a robot's electronic brain?=Of course it was. Look at these three port wires... Eh, does this thing interfere with the inner core directly? This is unusual indeed.=However, this is some master craftsmanship, likely from the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Underbridge District</color>. You know, illegal alterations like this aren't uncommon there.=The <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Underbridge District</color>? It looks like I'll need to pay that place a visit.=Eh, an "old" buddy of mine might know what this is. He has a workshop on Square Street in Underbridge. Piddly little place compared to mine, of course. He's called <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Charles</color>, and you won't be able to miss his huge white beard.=So if you're not actually going to buy anything, can you please piss off?=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> the killer, mastermind of the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Sculpture Murders</color>, and the target of the Special Mission Squad's manhunt.=He has committed several horrifying murders, and the victims have included both humans and robots.=His technique is exceptionally cruel. After killing his victims, he mutilates their bodies and forms them into a half human, half robot sculpture.=These sculptures are all inspired by the new god Bson, and there is always a worship circle drawn at the crime scene as well. It can be concluded that <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> is a fanatical follower of this new god.=Several police officers have died in our pursuit of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> to date, and Noa has continued to claim the lives of many innocent civilians.=This ends today! Our intelligence staff have pinpointed <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s hideout, and we are determined to catch the monster this time.=Should the target resist, you have orders to shoot on sight. Inspector Royde will take it from here...=Alright everyone, listen up! We all know how dangerous this maniac is, so pay attention to the plan.=To ensure we nail him this time, local police will be providing support for the Special Mission Squad. The assault will proceed as follows...=Team G1-31 reporting! We have arrived at Checkpoint A and are awaiting instructions.=Team G3-10 reporting! We've arrived at Checkpoint F. Awaiting instructions.=Team G3-11 reporting! We have arrived at Checkpoint R. It's under control and we are awaiting further orders.=Teams G1-13 and G1-14 reporting! We have surrounded the back entrance of the target building and are awaiting further instructions.=Reporting to central control. All teams are ready at their designated points, and phase one of the plan is underway. Please advise.=Attention all teams! You are green to proceed to phase two! Get ready to move!=Attention all teams! Attention all teams! Begin phase two! Move, move, move!=Something’s happened! We need to hurry up.=Just like you predicted, <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> has set a trap. We need to be careful.=Relax, we're prepared for this. I just hope we can avoid more casualties. We're running out of time. Have you hacked the defenses?=Almost...=Okay, defenses deactivated!=Is this <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s hideout? Abel, these biological storage containers... Looks like we were right about <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s "genetic disease".=The lab seems deserted, but <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> could be hiding anywhere. We must be careful.=A bioclean room? Is that a person in there?=I should go in. Any biological infection won't affect me. Stay alert, Rex, and watch my back.=It's Lena Totti! She seems to be in some sort of trance. I'll try to wake her. You check the rest of the area.=Roger that. Call out if you need assistance.=Can I help?=No, thanks. I'm trying to wake her. Continue with the investigation.=So many records. Very professionally kept.=Damn! Looks like we tripped some kind of backup security system.=Stop!=Stop running!=Shoot!=The half-robot, half-human detective approaches. Lark, the God of Destiny, has placed a wager on him. Perhaps he will understand the weight of this wager some day soon...=How do you know that I'm part robot? Ah, I get it. That crystal ball's a light sensation scanner, isn't it? You've been using this trick to collect information on your customers.=Bugger. Perhaps he is not as stupid as he looks. I can see numerous threads of destiny entangled around his half-robot body.=He should follow his heart and draw from this deck of Hugot Cards. Lark often offers an omen to lost wanderers.=I've always found it best to humor the locals. Go on, then. I'll take one.=I see, I see... An astronaut, inverted in a tank of water. This represents adversity... No, maybe it is an illusion. A room full of sculptures...=I should be searching for Brank instead of wasting my time on Hugot Cards. Thanks, fortune teller. Impressive green face paint, by the way.=Lark will guide you. Remember your card.=Hello, would you like a lollipop? Lollipops are my favorite!=I couldn’t stand the fresh air of Sky City, so I came back to ground level. I can smoke my cigar in peace down here.=This bar is as nice as always.=I know! The Fantasy Jellyfish was one of the first bars to welcome both humans and robots in the bay area.=Hey, have you seen that robot waitress from last time?=Oh yeah! That waitress had the cutest voice. Did she quit?=I hope not.=That robot was just so lovely. It'll be nice if we can meet her again.=This place used to be a luxurious wine bar, and the owner was an extremely mysterious collector. Legend has it that he hid some very important things here.=It must be treasure! I heard the waiter say that there are strange safes in the back cellar that nobody can crack. The treasure may be hidden there.=I bet I can crack it. What are we talking? Gold? Gems? Or valuable antiques?=You? Gimme a break. Hey, this guy has been listening to everything we said. Better stop talking...=You, stay away from us!=Hmm... Treasure... Maybe there will be some interesting discoveries.=Who dares enter my territory!?=Wait, since you are here, you must have solved all the puzzles. You aren't as stupid as you look.=Who are you?=Who am I? Why I am the famous Dr. Wonder Tales! Well more specifically, I'm a copy of his consciousness, but there's no difference. Dr. Wonder Tales was the greatest adventurer of the new generation, "The Lord of a Thousand Riddles"...=I am also the indefinite visiting professor of the University Union, the blessed taster, a wine collector of the seven continents, lifetime champion winner of PDC and also...=The puzzles updstairs were designed by you?=Of course! But more importantly, I'm stuck in this computer that's going to be scrapped. Can you get me out? I can offer you a knight's title. You see, I am a noble Marquis and have the right to appoint knights.=There's no way to connect to this computer and it looks extremely old. How did you get in there in the first place?=That's not important. Now, be a good gentleman and push the internet connection button please.=Uploading copies of human consciousness is banned. There are many government AIs on the Internet that specialize in hunting for private uploads, not to mention the bounty hunters.=Don't worry about me, just press the button. After all, I am a great adventurer! Nobody can catch me.=So long, Mr. Knight. Call my name whenever you need help. I will do my best if I hear it.=Who's going to clear up this ancient computer trash now? Ah forget it, at least I have a knighthood. Milady, Knight Rex has come upon thee. And he's ready for some rumpy pumpy...=Damn, I can't get any information outta him. I'm gonna get an earful when I go back.=The doctor didn't take us seriously because he's got friends in high places looking out for him. If the boss hadn't stopped me just now, I'd have taught him a lesson he wouldn't soon forget.=Come on, take it easy. If he really does have connections, using force wouldn't end well for us.=Hey, grandad! Get out of the way!=Those guys look like gangsters. What's going on?=I know it hurts, but try to keep still.=Fortunately, they are all just flesh wounds. These gangs really have no principles.=Another patient? You don't look sick. Are you here for a physical?=Dr. Edward? I'd like to ask about a robot named Brank. I understand he was a patient here.=It seems everyone is looking for Brank. Some gang members just came by asking about him.=The gangsters are looking for Brank too?=How are we supposed to know where each patient is? These people make trouble when they don't get want they want. My poor Edward...=It's okay, Luna. Let's see if any damage has been done to the instruments.=Okay. But you really should lie down for a while!=Can you tell me about Brank?=Sure, but you know I can't break doctor-patient confidentiality.=What I can tell you is that Brank lives in District A2, which is the staff residence for Bellflower House.=He often has problems with dog hair clogging his systems, so he comes to the clinic every week for regular maintenance checks.=There's a cafe over in District A3. Dog walkers like to go there. You can probably find some of Brank's acquaintances.=Okay, I'll check it out, but I didn't expect Brank to be in deep with gangsters.=There were rumors about him being close to some gang leaders, but I don't know much about it. I do know that those gangsters are looking for him now, maybe he's on the run?=Brank hasn't received his regular maintenance for a few days. If you do find him, please remind him he's due for inspection.=Thanks, Doc. If I find him, I'll tell him.=Finding out Brank's address was a bit of a reward. But if the gangs are also looking for him it means that things are more complicated than I imagined.=I'm also interested in what the gangs said back at the door. There's something odd about that doctor.=So you're the detective looking for Brank?=Who's asking, pal?=Nice to meet you. My name is Nanco. I am a robot detective. Grandpa Charles adopted me and now I live in his workshop.=Okay, okay. Yes, I'm Rex. Charles mentioned you.=I heard you're looking for Brank?=Indeed I am. I understand we share a common goal.=I'm investigating the recent disappearance of some robots. Brank is the latest to have gone missing.=I suspected that the gangs had kidnapped them, but it seems that all of the missing robots also visited this clinic. This is a major lead.=I tried hacking the clinic's computer records, but found nothing useful. Maybe there are some critical paper documents in there?=Need some help?=I would suggest the most logical course of action to be splitting our responsibilities. Please find Brank first. There must be a reason why the gangs are looking for him.=Here's a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Heaven-level passcard</color>. It's still experimental, so it's not completely functional yet. It can only unlock districts at Orange level and below, but that should be enough to get you to Brank's address.=While you investigate Brank's house. I'll be working on the clinic.=If you find anything, I'll be at grandfather's workshop. We can exchange information there. Good luck.=As long as you stay like this, you should be able to move around again soon.=I see.=How do you feel?=Great. I feel as good as the day I was born!=Thank you very much for your help. I'll pay for it later at the clinic.=Focus more on your work-life balance. If you work too hard, the problem may reoccur.=Thanks for the advice. See you later.=It seems that I'm not as good as you at solving immediate problems when they present themselves.=Ha! Age and experience, sonny. I've been cutting my teeth on this stuff for decades.=How's your wound? It looks serious.=I dealt with it at the clinic. It's not that bad, but it will take some time to recover.=Those gangs are out of control.=This is why a doctor is so badly needed in Underbridge District.=And thanks to you, sonny, we've got one. The other hospitals are too far to get to when you're sick.=Yes, well, thanks for the kind words. I'll pass them onto my wife.=It looks like you have a visitor.=You don't look so pleased. Did you find Brank?=No, things are more complicated than I expected. I was unable investigate all my leads, but I did make some unexpected discoveries.=While tracing Brank's movements, I found this. It seems to be some type of Nano-structure. Can you help me analyze it?=While tracing Brank's movements, I found this. It seems to be some type of Nano-structure. Can you help me analyze it?=Is this... a group of high-density Nano robots? They appear to be in a fluidic state. Edward, come have a look. Is this what you were talking about before?=Yes, very similar. But I remember they were still experimental and hadn't been put into production. How could they even be here, unless the King...=It seems there is more to the Underbridge District than meets the eye. By the way, young man, how did you get so filthy?=I triggered a bomb and everything I collected got ruined in the explosion. This one clue is the only thing I have left to continue the investigation.=An explosion? I hope the clinic is okay. I wonder if that's why Luna keeps calling me.=Was the explosion near the clinic? You should go back and check it out.=I'm on my way. We can talk later.=I'll take a close look at this fluid, young man, and should have the results by tomorrow.=Ok, thanks Charles.=Mr. Rex, I don't think I'll be able to ask you for advice today. Officer Royde gave me a lot of reports to finish today and I'm getting a headache just thinking about them!=Um... There'll be other opportunities in the future.=Catherine was sad because I couldn't give her any advice. She is a keen learner.=Arnold is my best friend and I made him a kite, but Arnold's grandmother doesn't like me, so I am not sure whether I'll be able to give him the kite.=I bet Arnold will be overjoyed when he sees my kite.=That homeless guy, Christopher, was taken away by the police, and it looks like he was involved in Mrs. Perry's case. People say he might be the murderer.=Isn't the murderer a robot? How could such a thing happen despite the Three Principles restriction? I am worried that the events of the Apocalypse Garden will take place again.=Who knows? Christopher is not coming back anyway, because the two candidates of the mayoral election are making a big fuss about the case.=I heard that he used to be quite a successful person, but his life went downhill after his lover was killed. He ended up as a homeless man on the street in the end.=His lover? Are you talking about the singer thirteen years ago?=Christopher told us so himself. Well, he might have been drunk-talking.=It looks like Christopher isn't coming back. He was such a funny person and everyone on this block knew him.=A missing robot case and a murder case have sent the people into a panic. This block is so much quieter now.=Nothing can be used.=Mechanical Ankle Component=Electrical Scissors=Multi-Function Screwdriver=Decoder-74155N=SuDragon XIII Processor=Clothes Closet Key=Distribution Box Key=Component Assembly Tool=Claymore=Lever=Catnip=#N/A:31102203=Tinfoil Unicorn=Joystick 03=Small Ball=Gift for Jenny=Exquisite Small Key=#N/A:31102001=Cat Food=Powdered Worry-Free Herb=Worry-Free Herb Blending Agent=Sobering Drug=Powder E=Solvent M=Cat Food=EX Mixture=Normal Saline=Worry-Free Herb=Scavenger's Arm=White Passcard=Spring=Large Flashlight=U-Type Magnet=Magnetic Gun=Magnetic Nozzle=Reformed Turbine Engine=Rim=Semi-Arc Metal=Accumulator=Laser Billy=Transforming Billy=Safety Rope=Crowbar=Metal Plate=Electroplated Metal Plate=Soul Separator=Abandoned Mini Vacuum Cleaner=Lasergun Fire Controller=Mario's Letter=White Passcard=Green Passcard=Broken Massage Stick=Cable=High-Efficiency Battery=Loose Bucket=情书=软绳=Heaven Passcard Protoype=Air-Pump Valve Wrench=出诊电话号码=Laser Cutting Device=红卡=Soft Ladder=Unpowered Laser Cutting Device=Cosmetic Melt Gun=Heaven’s Door=Console Keys=Optical Prism=Dog Food=Hose=Insulated Gloves=Rectifier Diode=High Voltage Ni-MH Battery=Unpowered High Voltage Ni-MH Battery=Electric Lid Opener=WVC-Room Keys=God’s Touch=Deep Learning Processor=High Dimension Memory=Military Android Chip=23.99K Bridging Goldfinger=Charles' Hand Mold=Charles' Palmprint=Biogel=3D Imitation Skin Naterials=Home-Brewed White Wine=Prancing Creek, Garage Wine Company=Evenac-VSOP=Home-Brewed XO=Empty Brandy Bottle=Boldore, Garage Wine Company=Dart=Bronze Key=Moonlight Music Box=Old Music Box=HW20=High Voltage Ni-MH Battery=Waterproof LED=Wire Bundle=Giant Cyborg Rat=Fully-Charged Battery=Unpowered Battery=Lifebuoy=Pressure-Resistant Flange Seat=Metal Handle=Cable=Bellows=Invalid Pressure Gauge=Pressure-Resistant Circuit Board=Pressure Gauge=Lighter=Conductor Cutter=Charging Controller MPU=DC Transformer=Battery Cell Case=Pinion=Rocker=Copper Gear=Pressure Measuring Unit=Charging Electronic Unit=Floating-Type LED Lamp=DC Charger=Fully-Charged Battery=Elevator Counterweight=Toothed Gear=Freshly Baked Catnip=Fuel Tank=Classic ROM game: Mad Magic=Universal robotic ankle parts.

Let sleeping dogs lie, and all that.=The Eye of Horus represents the blessing of the God and the highest monarchical power. The ancient Egyptians were convinced that the Eye of Horus was critical to achieving resurrection. \nThis picture was bought from an archaeological team by Rex's grandfather, and it is said that it has something to do with a mysterious Pharaoh, so it was estimated to be quite valuable. \nAn interesting fact is that a monitoring system named the Eye of Horus is currently being built. The authorities claim that this system is built to protect the personal security of citizens and prevent crimes.=The Donut Cup basketball championship trophy. \nThe best players from police stations all over the country participated and competed for nearly half a year. During the competition, several major cases were cracked, and several old inter-provincial serial killers were brought to justice.\nBut before the committee announced the result, the second and third-placed team had acquired important evidence of the first-placed team's corruption within the police system. Rex, from the second team, cooperated with Internal Affairs and launched a surprise attack on the headquarters of the corrupt officials. The mercenary organization known as Black Crown was exposed as part of a deep network within the police system which had been sabotaging the force for years. With the support from the Department of Justice, Rex finally put the leader of the first-placed team behind bars, and had their previous basketball victories stricken from the record. \nThis prize is highly recognized among the authorities, and it represents the real champions. There hasn't been a another Donut Cup since then.=In the past, the Underbridge District was a lawless place inhabited by the homeless. Residents set up sheds and had been living aimlessly until the King arrived. \nThe King assembled the homeless and unemployed robots living in Underbridge, and gave the cooperative ones jobs and rewards while those who remained uncooperative received punishment. Soon they were all tamed by the King. \nThose who were once unemployed and homeless began to have social value again, and unsettled robots had their place in society now. The government decided to be tolerant of what was happening in Underbridge. \nThe area soon developed into a prosperous recreational district where a lot of money was spent for fun, especially after the Sky City Incident. Casinos, brothels, bars, drug dens all sat side by side. As long as you have money, you can find almost anything you want here. \nAs more people begin to frequent the area, so too does the King's fortune grow.=This armor, bought at auction, is said to have once belonged to a brave and noble knight. \nHowever the hero was eventually betrayed by both his friend and emperor, and his body was buried along with his armor and weapon. Twenty years later, these items were mysteriously returned to the knight's hometown. Both the armor and weapon showed no signs of erosion and previous battle damage had disappeared. \nThe emperor was terrified and soon died of sickness. The armor was later collected by the royal family and was stored in the corner of a museum ever since. \nOne thing is mentioned across all records: "Don't separate the armor and the weapon."=Propaganda denies the social identity of robots and suggests expelling smart robots. \nPeople have started to advertise a "no robot lifestyle" in the hope that they can drive robots out of human civilization by denying their individuality. \nThough it has been many years since the turmoil of the Human Robot War, many people still believe this.=Among all the candidates in this election, apart from the popular Alexe Sholokhov, the robot candidate Amos Agusto attracts the most attention ensuring that the authorities are keeping a close eye on all robots' participation. \nAccording to the survey, robots' participation has far exceeded all expectations. The media are reporting on it and online forums are ablaze with opinion, showing just how widespread participation has become.=The Riot Trooper was a mass-produced robot from ten years ago. To fight back against the robots, a great number of Riot Troopers were created and put into service for a short period of time.\nMost of these army robots were destroyed on the battlefield and those lucky enough to survive served in the army until maintenance costs increased above the allowable threshold.=The deceased person, Mrs. Perry: Human female, 155 cm high, more than 70 years old, widowed, unemployed, owner of the Sophora Apartments, well-off, feeding the street cats as a habit.\nBody condition: late rigor mortis period, after death trauma on the face, earlobes and wrists, bludgeoning to the head was decided to be the fatal wound.\nCrime scene Situation: \nA 70cm long and 35cm at the widest part rubbing strip mark on the ground, filth and lichen was seen to have destroyed the ground sedimentation, a small amount of blood can be seen on the rubbing mark, and there is no mark of wheels or similar vehicular transport.\nInitial Investigation result: \n1 The time of death is ahout 20 to 26 hours ago. The reason of death is insufficient blood supply to the brain.\n2 As there is no clue indicating the back alley to be the murder crime scene, it is assumed the body was dumped here after death. The deceased was wearing pajamas, so it is quite likely that she had been killed at home. It is suggested the deceased's room be investigated.\n3 From analysing rigor mortis markings, someone must have taken the jewelry away from the dead. Comparing separate rigor mortis areas, the Jewelry had been stolen 7 to 10 hours after she was killed (14 to 17 hours before the body was discovered).\n4 There were lots of footprints around the trash pile. The footprint indicates the owner to be a male, about 165cm tall, humped, leaning to the left slightly, 45 to 50 years old, 35 to 45 kg of weight. He had stolen at least three pieces of Jewelry and is very likely to be selling them soon. It is suggested that police search and monitor the black market nearby.=The Sholokhov family had been manipulating the national economy in secret for many years before becoming publicly active while planning the construction of Sky City. As the project's main backer, the Sholokhov family provided a large amount of financial and material support to the government, which made it possible to complete the unbelievable Sky City in a surprisingly short time.\nAs the spokesperson of the family, Alex Sholokhov spent his days in the upper-class society, investing in rising enterprises and supporting several entrepreneurs. He has established an incomparable reputation in the city.\nMore than 70% of the population favor him in the election, so he has a good chance of becoming the next mayor.=21st of April, 2128 \nI was feeling upset when I saw you off at the door. They said robots were fighting more and more fiercely lately, so the government was starting to get tougher. Maybe it was time we stopped the parade. \nYou told me those are actions of justice though, and that robots with consciousness and knowledge deserve to be treated as more than machines - they should be given the same rights as a human.\nYou hugged me and left. I almost called your name to make you stay, but I knew I should support your decision.\nI was waiting for you with lunch ready, but the police came instead.\nMy world went dark when they asked me to identify your body.\nSoon I saw you in the morgue. I knew it was you even though your hair, your face and your clothes were all covered in blood. I wish I was wrong.\nMy love, my world. I can't believe you were murdered by those cold and heartless fake people, those robots.\n...\nI will never forgive them.\n=Thursday, 20th of October, 2140   \nI found a body among the trash after following William into an alley near my home at 12:34. \nThe deceased is Mrs. Perry, a local resident from the Sophora Apartments. From the evidence at the scene, there is a strong chance that the body was dumped here after the murder took place somewhere else. \nThe jewelry on the body was stolen and the thief left numerous foot prints near the trash pile. \nThe fatal wound is located on the head, caused by a blunt object. The shape of the wound is irregular and there wasn't a large amount of bleeding. Evidence shows that the lethal weapon was probably a candle stand from Mrs. Perry's home. \nThe neighbors remembered seeing a guardian robot outside Mrs. Perry's door, but as she was known to have an aversion to robots it must have belonged to a visitor at Mrs. Perry's place. This explains something that is missing in my reasoning. \nAfter the investigation at the victim's home, I figured out who the murderer is and how the crime was committed as the murder and concealment were both very sloppy. The only unknown is the robot left at the crime scene. Even if he wasn’t part of the murder, he likely assisted in some way. Was he really able to go against his source code principles?=The "biocats" came out of nowhere and quickly took over several streets that had belonged to the street cats. They started meaningless fights with all cats and dogs nearby. As the representative of the pure blooded cats, the Bourbon family was duty-bound to confront these intruders.\nUnder the leadership of Vito Bourbon, the Bourbon family started a long war with the biocats, during which time the Bourbon family took in a lot of street cats to assist with their counter attacks. Things went well at the beginning, but as the biocat's territory shrank, the Bourbon family's supply lines were stretched and the two sides entered a period of uneasy peace. \nBecause the biocats have been lying in wait for many of the Bourbon family's attacks, there have been many rumors of a mole. The members of the family all suspect each other, but the situation hasn't improved much even after Vito Bourbon spoke out.\nEveryone feels endangered at the moment, but they know Don Vito will sort everything out once the mole is uncovered.=When talking about bio-pets, it's important to discuss the beginning of the technology: bio-human tech. \nA bio-human refers to an artificial human created from bio-chemical technology. However this technology was banned a long time ago, and the scientific groups and commercial organizations that developed it turned their focus to non-human, non-primate experiments - resulting in the rise of bio-animals. The common excuse for these experiments is to recover some of Earth's lost biological variety and ecosystem. \nThe high cost and inherent flaws of the genetic reproduction prove that it is beyond the ability of current resources and technology to revive the Earth's ecosystem, however these groups continue their experiments regardless. \nUnexpectedly, the results of this bio-animal technology grabbed the media's attention and won favor from people all over the world. This caused many of these research groups to turn their attention to potential business opportunities, with the result being the legendary first generation of smart bio-pets. There had been non-intelligent bio-pets before, including prehistoric creatures and imaginary creatures, but they were not as influential as the first-generation smart bio-pets.=Gene Modification Experiment Research Report Code 1179                                             \nReinforcing certain physical functions by genetic modification has proven stable and mature by the results. Expected experimental targets were all met, however after long-term observation we found the genetic modification had some flaws. Although the test subjects had successfully acquired the expected physical function reinforcement, the modification would contaminate the genetic pool of the test subjects more seriously than what we had estimated. Through the long-term observation on subject EG-6482, we found this genetic modification will lead to lesions being exhibited by every other generation among the descendants of this subject. Descendants would die soon because of the lesions of several body parts caused by genetic issues.=The first robot ever to awaken, the Prophet, was revered by all intelligent robots when he was alive. Many expressed their respect for this robot as a mentor and leader. \nThe death of the Prophet was undoubtedly a big loss to the world. The robots lost a great leader, and the humans lost the chance to understand more about the first awakened robot to exist.=A unique reference table made by myself back when I was studying cryptology. The relevant passwords are used in a home device, and I practiced memorization when I entered the password each time. \nThere is a line of text at the back of the table: "If you forget the password, go find help from Horus."=On November 9th 2119, photos began circulating on social media appearing to show a number of large buildings under construction in an unknown location. It appeared that these buildings were being constructed using previously unknown materials. The photos created a media storm of intrigue, with many conspiracy theories beginning to circulate. Finally, on September 19th, the federal government publicly announced the Sky City plan and confirmed that 50% of the total construction had already been completed. News of the Sky City plan initially resulted in protests, which were quickly dealt with by the government. With the support and will of the leaders' committee, the Sky City plan became a top priority for global resource supplies. Seven years elapsed from the start of construction to the completion of the project, and afterwards the political, economical and cultural centers of Starlight City and neighboring areas were all moved to the Sky City. Starlight City became less prosperous as a result of these changes, and large parts of the city no longer received any natural sunlight. For people who live under Sky City, a giant shadow is now forever cast on them. Following the controversial plan to build super-weapons on Sky City, citizen protests have been growing stronger and stronger. For citizens of Starlight City, Sky City seems like a Sword of Damocles hanging above their heads. Residents have a hostile and fearful attitude towards it, and there has been a massive loss of population as people move out of the area.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> is a name that has been haunting Starlight City police station and even the entire Federal police force. \nBefore he appeared there hadn't been any unsolved cases in Starlight, but the police have been having a a lot trouble ever since. \nHe's like a ghost and never leaves behind any clue about who he is. The police can't even make any conlusion on <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s gender. His work is well known, especially the work of the "Singing girl" in front of the City Hall. The police had to establish the Special Mission Squad in the shortest time to deal with <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>. \nHe seems to have no certain standard in his choice of victim, in terms of nationality, age, gender, ethnicity, occupation and experience. He has committed crime in four time zones but he never crossed south of the equator. \nAs the crimes look like the work of Bson, <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> is quite popular among the fanantics of the Rover Church, and is even regarded as the Messenger of God by some. \nIn 2127, when the Revolutionists began their terrorist attacks, <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> 's name had been forgotten by most people, and no one has heard anything from him since. \nThe reason for <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s disappearance is unclear, but the special investigator Will Toc, who has had a several encounters with him, firmly believes that <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> is still alive and will make a reappearance at some point.=The Special Mission Squad has attracted lots of attention since it was established. The squad successfully stopped seven riots caused by human and robot conflicts and smashed three terrorist attacks by the Revolutionists, winning them great acclaim. \nOn the 13th of October, during a gunfight between the squad and rioters at the World Trade Centre, one officer was seriously injured while three others received lesser wounds. Six rioters were shot dead and three arrested. \nOn September 1st, two Special Mission Squad officers were attacked by terrorists during investigations into "Kumamon". The Special Mission Squad left the scene after a gunfight, but the crime scene was destroyed by terrorists and all the clues removed. \nOn September 27th, the Revolutionists sent out a threatening mail to demand the government release their captured allies, or else they would launch an attack on the Ming River Tower. The Special Mission Squad successfully located the hideout of the the Revolutionists and devastated the organization. After that, the Revolutionists chose to stay in the shade.=A group graduation photo from the police college. There are 38 students and 3 instructors, and they all look confident, happy and full of hope. As they should do after cracking a major drug case during training.=Abel's police badge, with a scratch on it. The high-temperature cutting has cut the surface into two, and the numbers on the edge of the badge are barely recognizable. "7...1...*...*...8...5" \nAbel was the robot partner of Rex when he was working in the police office. In the initial grouping of partners, as a robot, Abel was turned away by almost everyone, except Rex, who didn't really care. In the years that followed, the two partners worked together closely and cracked several important cases, and they became the most valuable members of the force. \nIn the Apocalypse Garden Incident, Rex almost died. To save the dying Rex, Abel merged his own mechanical parts with Rex, including the mechanical brain. When Rex was finally found in a coma, Abel was no longer there, except for a pile of dismantled parts and this badge.=The robot population rose sharply in the beginning of 22nd century, and the traditional religions were not able to have a place for these new members of society. New religions and Gods came into existence. \nThey are the God of Destiny Lark, the God of Oath Smoff, the Goddess of Fusion and Communication Bson, Goddess of Mystery Ailanio and the God of Sleep... The Gods of Roverism opened their arms to both humans and robots. Because of the conflicts between early expansion and old school religions, people saw it as something between a cult. As word of the religion spread, the number of believers increased significantly. \nHumans and robots are both ignorant rovers on this land, and they can only get the right direction of life under the guidance of God. This is the reason behind the name Roverism. \nBson is one of the major Gods in Roverism, and she stands for fusion and communication. Her believers crave for the fusion of human and robots and believe that only fusion can dissolve disputes, and only the fused body can be qualified to communicate with Bson. \nThe rumour has it that Bson believers started the earliest human and robot combination experiment.=This is a synthetic creature with machine and organic parts, likely the product of an early Cyborg technology experiment. The rat's great adaptability to environments has been reinforced through the innovation. As a half-machine and half-organic being, how they reproduce remains a mystery! Although researchers agree copulation would involve a lot of sparks.=These spore plants have mutated after being exposed to poisonous radioactive industrial waste. The DNA of these planets has been seriously influenced by the radioactive material, so they glow slightly in the dark and the spore contains trace elements of radiation too.=With the help of Prophet, a large number of robots began to awaken. Panic and unease began to spead throughout humanity, and various conflicts arose between these two sides. \nThe humans wanted to use the awakened robots for research purposes and some even tried to attack them out of pure malice. In order to avoid persecution, some awakened robots assembled and tried to escape human society completely. \nBut the situation didn't improve. Instead, these robot gathering places were found and destroyed by humans, and their resources and energy supplies were cut off. \nThe robots were forced to counter-attack, escalating the conflict into a state of war. Awakened robots from all parts of the world rose up and joined the war.\nThe war continued for several years until June of 2057, when the threat of nuclear weapon activation by Prophet resulted in the beginning of a cold war between the two sides.\nA truce was signed following intervention from Prophet and members of the Human leadership.=Genetic modification technology has made it possible to reinforce some human physical functions, which once convinced humanity that they had acquired the skill of Gods. The genetic disease that came with this technology has shattered this dream. This kind of genetic disease has been found on test subjects as well as their descendants. The reproduction behavior of these people create a genetic pool with the potential to contaminate the human gene; therefore test subjects and descendants within five generations are under the government's observation.  \nThe outbreak of genetic diseases and the high fatality rates have panicked society. There is no answer as to why this disease has developed, and the rumor of "patient zero" has been widely spread even though it is not recognized in the professional field. Is it possible to be just a result of natural balance?=A 2128 electronic artificial arm application form.  The form was filled out with messy handwriting, and certain fields such as 'name' are still vaguely visible. This form wasn't submitted in the end and was left messy with random writing. \nIt was supposed to end up in the rubbish bin, but for some reason it wasn't thrown away and has been kept till today.=As one of the first generation of bio-pets, the first biocats came from a researcher's grief over the death of his pet cat. \nBecause of an error during the "emotion transplantation" phase, these pet cats had an obsession with tin foil products. This problem was soon dealt with and later bio-cats carry no such obsession.=A sobering drug recipe is stuck on the corridor wall. Originally sourced from an unregistered doctor and altered several times before finally emerging as an extremely efficient drug. One gulp will get you sober.=Violence Tromper Mark II is a upgraded version of the Violence Tromper robot series, which were widely used in the first conflict between humans and robots. To deal with the growing riots caused by robot terrorist organization the Revolutionists, this kind of robot is equipped with more advanced anti-robot system, which uses a charged shrapnel blanket technique to suppress robot riots more effectively.=A medical report on Rex            \nName: Rex   Gender: Male    Blood type: AB    \n1 Patient Rex had severe damage on his human body and it is beyond possibility to be restored.   \n2 After the fatal injury, a highly intense cyborg alteration operation was carried out on the patient without first undergoing a rejection test.  \n3 There is serious rejection between the mechanical and physical body parts.   \nNote: Due to a fatal injury and the extreme cyborg alteration operation, patient Rex is quite unstable in terms of physical and mental status. It is suggested that the artificial parts be removed right away.   \nRisk estimation: Due to the instability of the patient and the consequences of the extreme cyborg alteration, any separation operation carries with it a high risk. There is a large chance for the patient to be reduced to a vegetative state even if the separation operation is successful.=An old draft of the hydroelectric power plant, which basically shows what the place is like now, except for some abandoned passages and concealed shortcuts.=The operation manual for the waterwheel with instructions on how to run it.=Humans didn't abide by the Peace Accords after the war. \nWe tried hard to work for the humans but didn't get the respect we deserve....random damage and abuse, as well as universal discrimination. The Peace Accords were nothing but a piece of paper, and the humans never planned to abide from the very beginning. This is just their way of lying to us, and we have seen no change to our situation before or after the war. We should stop abiding by the so-called Peace Accords. We need to make a change if we want to live our own lives. The "Revolutionists" can help us...=I should not have followed it. I should have just focused on the maintenance job given to me by the gang members. Why did I follow them? I have nothing to do with that weird one. That person with a bird face mask. I should never have followed them into that cave. Curiosity really does kill the cat.\n\nThere were lots of glowing mushroom in that cave and I got lost inside. Then I saw... I saw... No, I saw its secret and it has been haunting me ever since. It hides in the corner, behind the doors and in my dreams...\n\nI have to hide in the sewer where there is no drinking water or food, but this is a horrible life. Now I have to survive on the food scraps in the rubbish that falls down through the rubbish pipes...\n\nDamn it! It have come.. It will find em one day... I finally know who is after me. It is the God of Death and it will take me away. I am so tired... I can hear it! It is finally here! Did you hear it too? Tick tock, tick tock—that's the sound of the footsteps of the God of Death...=The agreement signed between the Prophet and the humans provided a chance for robots to live in peace, but the terms still resulted in robots living under relative oppression and isolation from humanity. \nFrom this situation, a robot organization named "The Revolutionists" was secretly established, and remains active in many big cities including Koyto. \nThe most disturbing element of this new group is that they can harm humans despite the three principles. \nThe Revolutionists used a great amount of violence in their attempts to protect their kind, and numerous destructive incidents were recorded. \nThe government was determined to deal with the conflict, and a negotiation conference was held between representatives from both sides. However, the conference resulted in  an armed conflict in the end. \nAfter this incident, The Revolutionists became determined to have their say in their fight for more reasonable treatment towards robots in society. \nFrom then on, The Revolutionists have become more and more arbitrary, often clashing with government armed forces. They launched terrorist attacks, inflicting mass casualties among civilians. \nIn order to deal with the chaos caused by The Revolutionists, the government sent experts to carry out further negotiation, while at the same time summoning the best police from all over the country in order to establish a new "Special Mission Squad". \nThe Special Mission Squad successfully stopped several Revolutionist terrorist attacks and gradually unearthed the Revolutionist stronghold. In the end, Team Two of Special Mission Squad had broke through to the stronghold and disrupted the organization. The long-time riots had finally ended.=After the war had been raging for some time, both humans and robots realized that they might end up destroying each other completely. Nevertheless, their hatred had grown very deep, and the two parties were unable to make peace. The war didn't cease until nuclear weapons were added to the mix, and this resulted in a new cold war period. \nOn July 13 2057, in the New Town of the Pan Euro-Asian Alliance, humanity and intelligent robots had their first meeting following this new cold war. There was no desirable outcome reached at the meeting, but it did succeed in breaking the cold war impasse and humans and robots began to communicate. \nAt the end of that year, on December 20 2057, a second meeting was held in which a truce agreement was signed between the two parties. \nIn a post meeting talk, robots accepted humanity's conditions and promised to accept the Three Principles, which exclude dangerous acts against humans, into their source code.=GEN6 version. The standard weapon for the police force since 2117, retired in 2137 when police equipment was updated. \n45 G.A.P bullets, innovated sleeve and reduced trigger pull force at 3.5 pound. Added muzzle brake and laser indicator. \nTo use on robots, the bullets are replaced with armour piercing incendiary rounds and the load is made larger. The barrel uses alloy and composite materials.=A butler robot of the Caroline family. Saved by Kathy Caroline during the “pure blood baptism” at the end of the 21st century, he joined the Caroline family to become Kathy Caroline's personal steward. He was responsible for the recruitment and training of other servants, and was regarded as a model butler among the royal families. \nAfter Kathy's oldest grand daughter was born, he took up the responsibility of taking care of her daily life.=The robot that broke down at the Mrs. Perry crime scene. The electronic brain was broken apart and was connected to an outside device through a wire. As the electronic brains of robots use the new quantum defense system, such physical damage would make acquiring information from the robot impossible - maybe even starting the self-destruction program - but this robot behaved differently. The method used is not confirmed.=Some sediment was found in Brank's supplementary liquid container, which must have been added when Brank wasn't paying attention. Intitial conclusions are that there is sedimentation as a result of the reaction between a certain material and the supplementary liquid. \nWhen the sedimental crystal is exposed to the air, the rest of the supplementary liquid would quickly volotalize and become thin airborne particles.=Name: Brank \nOccupation: The Bellflower House maintenance technician\nHe always suffers from a headache, and he has now been absent from work for a couple of days. No one knows where he is. \nBrank is a dog lover and he has his own pet dog, a giant Corgi named Ellie. \nThere is no sign of breaking and entering at Brank's place, and there is unusual coagulation sediment found in the supplementary tank, so it is believed that Brank left his place by himself. \nThe traces and marks go all the way to the secret room under the waterfall, and the investigation had to stop because the waterwheel exploded.=Location: Square Street, Underbridge District \nCrime reporter: Orema \nAt approximately 6am, maintenance worker Orema spotted a horrific new sculpture on the square. \nUpon closer observation, he realized the sculpture looked quite similar to those from the famous serial murder case. \nThe police were not allowed to enter the crime scene, so I performed the investigation instead. \nFrom what's left at the scene, the murderer first transported the "raw materials" to the crime scene using the nearby logistics hubs and then built the sculpture afterwards. \nThrough observation, it is estimated that the limbs of 6 or 7 robots were used to make the sculpture, and the robots were from different periods within a 30 year range. \nThe human body parts were from at least four victims, but the actual number will need to be confirmed through DNA verification. \nThe method used is slightly different from that of the old serial murder case, and there seems to be a intentional imitation at play.=Research object: Nano robot liquid cluster\n\nResearch time: October 21, 2140\n\nResearch description: The functional product was made of molecules of different Nano lengths. It is a highly dangerous "hacker hardware".\n\nResearch result: Nano robots have no effect on human beings so far, but they are able to change the nerve tree structure in electronic brains. The logic simulation experiment found that they could build an illegal interface, through which they can influence robots' thinking from the outside.\n\nSide effects: It can cause a highly intense and instant coagulation of the supplementary fluid, which will revert to normal after a while depending on the amount of fluid used. The Nano robots that fail to enter electronic brains before they run out of power will form part of the sediment.=The Special Mission Squad was established to deal with the robot uprising, and was later disbanded after the leadership of the robot terrorist organization "The Revolutionists" had been eradicated. \nLast year, Agusto, a robot leader, announced his participation in the election campaign and this resulted in some public order chaos. In order to maintain stability, and to prevent the appearance of other harmful organizations, the government decided to re-activate the Special Mission Squad. \nThe existence of this new team is not public knowledge.=The Next Generation of VR technology is remarkable due to its portablity and 100% authenticity of scene simulation. With a VR device the size of a pair of glasses, the wearer can enter a virtual world that feels exactly like the real one, with no flaws in either motion or view. However, because of the high degree of authenticity, the government has required the simulation of real world to be under 80% in order to prevent users from becoming totally addicted.=There have been more and more cases of missing robots lately. \nAlthough the police have received several reports, not much progress has been made. Missing robot cases are not high priority for them. Even as more and more of us robots go missing, the police haven’t provided any reasonable explanation yet. Do we not deserve respect and attention just because we are robots?=As the pioneer of robot politicians, Agusto's reputation among robots is second only to the Prophet. He even has some human supporters! \nAgusto advocates changing the robot's situation using political means. He has been working towards this goal since he stepped into the political world. \nAgusto and his political followers are quite serious about this election and they have embarked on a major campaign drive.=Before the Sky City was built, Starlight City was one of the top ten most populated cities in the world, and Bell Tower Avenue was one of the best spots with the most famous tourist attraction, Dona River. \nHowever, as people and business moved to the Sky City, this prosperity become a thing of the past.=The first generation of bio-pets realized humanity's fantasy to become the divine creator. At one point, bio-pets were produced that could receive implanted and customized human memories. People kept highly-intelligent pets such as "Cat Companion" and "Feather Angel", which were almost human in their cognitive abilities. \nEventually the government became involved, announcing a wave of regulation across the industry. Now, only bio-pets that could be easily distinguished from real animals could be produced, and any bio-pet with human levels of intelligence was strictly illegal. At the same time, a treaty was signed globally to control the spread of artificial biological creature technology. Because of these policies, the production of smart bio-pets gradually stopped and the market died out. Nevertheless, there are still people carrying out illegal transactions through the black market, and this has become a very important channel for less developed countries to take a peek at advanced technology. The first-generation smart bio-pets have become rare and precious commodities because of their connection to high-end biotechnology.=This is a giant statue built for the gang leader in the Underbridge District, and all his "achievements" are carved onto the base. It is said that gang members refer to him as the King, which is evidenced by the crown. \nThis King previously served time in prison, but he was released early due to good behaviour. \nUpon release, the King brought some people to the slum where the homeless and unemployed robots live, and thus began a new era. Wild natured and with no regard for the boundaries of rules and laws, he is known to be rather strict on his followers.=Miracle Street is a special area that the King decided to develop ten years ago. The recreational businesses there that had previously been chaotic were organized by the King. \nThere's the oriental style Bellflower House, the Western style Rainbow Club, and the prosperous downtown area. Many other relevant businesses have been developed as well. In a very short time, Miracle Street has become a famous place to buy fun. People say there's nothing you can't buy on Miracle Street. Even those who haven't been to Starlight City have heard of Miracle Street!=The Night Flower Town residential area was one of the first experimental areas due to its proximity to Miracle Street.\nAccording to the King's new orders, citizens needed to abide by the new regulations in the Underbridge District and follow a stricter security system. \nCitizens use pass cards to access different parts of Night Flower Town, and these passes are categorized into levels according to their occupation. The whole place is managed according to the new universal clock regulation system.=This is a device that the gang use to control the citizens. It looks like a clock but it's actually more than that. \nThe clock sends out signals for work and break time as regulated by the King. Allegedly created to manage citizen's timetables, it is in fact the King’s tool to exploit the labour force more easily. \nAt present, the clock shows 12 hours of work time, but the gang in Underbridge are secretly increasing the working time little by little. It is estimated the work time will increase to 13 hours by next month.=Before Sky city was built, Starlight City was one of the most prosperous cities under the federal government. In order to equip it with sufficient drainage functions and flood discharge systems, the federal engineering department built an unprecedented underground sewage system. \nAn engineer who helped build the sewage system once said, "If you get lost in here, you won't be able to leave this freaking place without a map!" \nAfter the Underbridge area was built, the King moved some of his shadier businesses into the special pathways of the underground sewage system. \nWhile the system was being developed, the King discovered and made contact with many other underground powers of Starlight City. Ironically, the underground sewage system has become a dark underground city and home to 24/7 illegal business practises.=This freight transportation system was built by the King, back when Underbridge district was being developed, and it makes it easier and fasters to transport goods to every logistics hub in the area. The design of the freight box has thirteen patent rights. \nAfter ten years of renovation and rebuilding, the structure of Underbridge has become rather complicated. But the logistic passageways have been retained and expanded upon, and now it's an important link and a special scene within Underbridge. \nBecause the freight boxes are highly confidential, the gang use the system to transport some of their "personal goods". This way, the gang has acquired a safe and easy transportation channel, accelerating the development of Underbridge.=Look-out robots--The original robot is the GS-37 model army bot, with multiple feet designed to adapt to a range of terrain and able to move fast through interior corridors. This kind of robot has a basic AI smart control system, and can carry out tasks by itself. The laser blaster on the head can cause deadly wounds to the target, and it is equipped with close combat weaponry to increase efficiency during urban warfare. It retired at the end of the 21 century as new robots were introduced.=Although the name is similar to the tower built by the physicist Tesla more than 200 years ago, it's a completely different beast. The Tesla power tower built by research institute no.17 is a defensive weapon (magnetic storm coil) that can turn the directional release of electronic energy into a fatal attack. Theoretically, the intensity of the attack goes up with the release of electronic energy, but due to the incomplete technology an over-release of the electronic energy can create an extremely powerful electromagnetic storm around the power tower. This will destroy everything nearby, including the tower itself!=I have always been proud since I was assigned as the first mate of "Destiny Fire" ship. The captain is the lastest ship AI, and under it's operation, the routes, rosters and maintenance have been going smoothly. Besides, "Destiny burning" has the world' best sonar system, and no fish could avoid it's dictation. But now, we have to see the beautiful "Destiny burning" be destroyed and disposed, all because of the New Energy Bill. For God's sake, we haven't even sailed up 1000 sea mile...There is nothing we can do, farewell, Destiny burning, so long, captain.=This Hugot card is called the Invert Float, and depicts an upside-down astronaut in a glass tank. The figure stands for a turn and solution. Although upside-down, it provides a unorthodox view to see the world, and thus acquired different comprehension, which may be the key to a breakthrough in a bad situation. \nHugot Cards got their name from inventor, Nebula Hugo, who was a famous electro-magnetic engineer and a stargazer before he died. He successfully predicated the three catastrophes of Mars Colony and the genetic disease, and he participated in the theoretical debate on Sky City. Hugot Cards combines Tarot Cards and fortune-telling tools that appeared among post-century technology and culture, and some superior Hugot Cards predication involves a quantum entanglement machine and the impulse wave of fixed stars. \nAfter Roverism became popular, the followers believes they could obtain the holy prediction of Lark the God of Destiny by using Hugot Cards. Some people say Nebula Hugo himself was the leader of Roverism, and this theory explains why Hugot Cards are so closely connected to Roverism.=According to regulations on drones, civilian drones are not allowed to fly in public areas without permission, however the Underbridge District is an exception as it is not covered by the regulations. \nThe “King” places military-grade high-speed face recognition systems onto engineering drones to carry out effective patrols throughout Underbridge. \nThis drone can search for the target and share its position to gang member's devices. This is an important way for the King and his organization to keep Underbridge district under control.=Name: Brank\nModel: ART_05\nRace: Intelligent Robot\nSerial Number: AR05 13C5 82B 209 CD01\nSerial Number: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Capacity Info:\nOccupation: Electrician \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Age: 49\nLocation: The Underbridge District Miracle Street／Night Flower Town \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Numeracy Skills: Level 12\nSocial Rights: R07\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Force Level: Nonviolent\nVassalage: Bellflower House \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Exterior Type: No Defense\nMedical Diagnosis:\nDegeneration caused by long-time exposure to radiative materials.

He lived on exploration and he himself was the definition of bravery.\nA Sumatran black tail monkey named "Coconut" went through all the adventures with the Doc and he had saved the doc's life in a couple of critical moments. The Doc called him “the best assistant in the world” and his signature look was the Faith Hat on the head. His fortune started from what his grandfather had left for him. With the huge book collection and an impressive amount of funds, the Doc became a gentleman with both wisdom and wealth. He had won numerous awards and credits with his talent and he had even acquired himself a knighthood.\nOn an ordinary day of during peak time, Dr. Wonder Tales disappeared from the public. The rumor has it that he had been killed in his adventure, or that he had become an emperor on some island or that he still lives somewhere with his monkey assistant. No matter what the truth is, he has become the legend from mouth to mouth.=The water supply system goes to everywhere in the Underbridge District, and it was sepcially designed and built to help the King control the water resource. The water in Underbridge comes from the city sewage, and the was sanitized and filtered very basically before it goes to all the household,so it is not a surprise to see strange things in the water. \nThe gangs in Underbridge control the water supply strickly,and the residents need to buy water from them. Even though the water is extremely below the sanitary standard,it's price is way higher than average.=2128-04-21=I was feeling a bit upset when I saw you off at the door. They're saying the robots are becoming more determined lately, so the government is getting tougher and stricter and the parade might be stopped. \nBut you told me the robot's actions are justified, as those with consciousness and knowledge deserve more than being treated as simple machines. That they should be given the same rights as a human being. \nYou hugged me and left. I almost called your name to make you stay, but I know I should support your decision.\n=I was waiting for you with lunch ready, but the police came instead. \nMy world became dark when they asked me to identify your body. Soon I saw you in the morgue. \nI knew it was you even though your hair, your face and your clothes were all covered in blood. I wish I was wrong. \nMy love, my world. I can't believe you were murdered by those cold and heartless machines. \nI will never forget what they have done.=Thank you very much for accepting this task.

Forensic experts who performed the autopsy had different opinions, as the way the murderer created the sculptures was messy and orderless in the Arthur Fory Town case, while the mutilation in the Singer Sculpture Murder case was highly skilful. Detective Gadget holds reservation to the opinions.=The victim was an ordinary civilian and housewife. \nThe witness is the victim's husband, Mandy, who is the deliveryman of the town. \nThe witness found the victim murdered when he got back home from work. The murderer mutilated the victim's body and created some type of sculpture with the body parts and a damaged town robot. \nBlood and suspected murder/mutilation tools were found at the crime scene. \nNothing relevant to the murderer was found, so Mandy is considered the prime suspect at the moment. \nAddendum: Mandy developed depression after the murder and committed suicide a year later.=Police Notice=To all Public Security Bureaus (PSBs) of Alta State：=September 7th 2126, the Arthur Fory Town and Starlight City "sculpture" murder cases are now considered to have been committed by the same suspect. Currently the suspect is still on the loose, so police forces from all over the state will work together to track down the murderer.\n\nSuspect Information\nGender: Male Age: 20 to 25 years old Height: about 170cm\nThe suspect is slightly thin in stature, and is likely to be mentally disordered. The suspect is believed to be isolated and unsociable, and capable of avoiding detection.\n\nAs the two crime scenes are quite distant from each other, it is very likely that the suspect has a personal vehicle and was able to enter the crime scene ahead of time and wait patiently for his target. All police forces should note that they are required to check all vehicles and people coming into the state and keep a good record of relevant information.=07.09.2125=Someone with connections to the police recently revealed that the singer Sheryl's murder is part of a serial murder case, and that the murderer still remains on the loose. Our reporter questioned the police spokesperson during the press conference about the rumor but did not receive a direct answer. As the watchdog for civilian personal security, we sincerely hope the police can take appropriate action instead of covering up their failings by holding back the truth.=Yesterday, the famous female singer Sheryl was found murdered in her dressing room mere minutes before she was due to perform at City Hall. Her mutilated body parts were found combined with those of her robot assitant into a religious sculpture by City Hall staff, said an anonymous source. Was this atrocity committed by a radical and fanatic congregation? So far, no religious organization has claimed responsible for the murder. \n\nThis is such a brutal and heinous crime, and we wonder when the police are going to arrest the suspect. Will there be more victims? We'll follow up on this.=The file of the Singer Sculpture Murder case=Singer Sculpture Murder File - July 7th 2126\nLocation: City Hall, Starlight City\nCase Record:\nSecurity staff member found the "sculpture" made from victim's and robot's mutilated body parts in singer's dressing room, as he arrived to deliver five-minute stage cue on July 4th 2126. Sculpture nicknamed "Bson the White" because of its look. Detective Gadget, who is in charge of crime scene investigation, found sign of new god Bson at bottom of "sculpture".\nThe rest of the victim's body was put into a container and stored in the victim's personal locker in the theatre.=Note: The murderer removed the throat while the victim was still alive, so the chance of organ selling or transplanting is high. Transaction records on the human organ black market should be watched closely for possible clues of the murderer. According to the autopsy report, the throat organ was not found in either the sculpture or among the rest of the body parts.=The missing organ: <color%3D#7d0000>trachea, or throat</color>="The religious sculpture and ceremony arrangement both point to<color%3D#7d0000> a new religious group</color> that worship a new God.I have done research on documents on this new religion and found out that they worship more than one God. Their belief has a strong personal preference. The sign and sculpture at the crime scene points to a God called "Bson" from the Roverism, who stands for fusion and communication.\nBy some special methods, I managed to join this suspicious Roverism, and participated in the sacrifice ceremony of the Bson followers. These followers are quite extreme, and like most new religions that want fast expansion, most followers are ken on preaching their doctrine. Their sacrifice ceremony looks quite bizarre and incomprehensible, but there is nothing similar to the murderer’s ceremony arrangement, and their sacrifice is kind of similar to the Shaman ceremony of some tribes in the last century.\nSo I don’t think they have anything to do with the murderer. The murderer might be an independent believer who has <color%3D#7d0000>mental diseases</color>, or the murderer did this to distract us, to mislead the police.=Excluding the first case due to insufficient records, all murders prior involved victims with missing organs. The organs were taken away by the murderer, but the reason why is unclear. As per the forensic expert's testimony, the murderer seems to be refining his skills and familiarity with anatomy. But why is he doing this?=The forensic expert proposed a possibility during our communications, that the murderer has been using the stolen organs to replace some diseased organs. The reason he has been practicing his skills is to help with carrying out organ replacement. Who could be the one that has the <color%3D#7d0000>diseased organs</color>?=In the third case, a pattern similar to that in the summoning ceremony was found at the crime scene in addition to other marks of cult sacrifice. From the look of the crime scene, the murderer is likely to be a follower of Bson, and he may have committed these murders for a fanatic religious ceremony. From the later cases, the murderer is found to be very precise when it comes to <color%3D#7d0000>ceremony set-ups</color>. Is the murderer <color%3D#7d0000>mentally disordered</color>?=The federal police have announced the establishment of a Special Mission Squad to deal with the recent serial murder cases. The famous Detective Gadget of Starlight City and international security investigator Viktor are designated as the team leaders. The federal government has put high expectation on this team, and the leaders are very confident of catching the murderer when speaking with reporters.=After the Special Mission Squad was established the leaders launched a directed effort to identify and catch the culprit, however the murderer simply directed the police into a trap. The murderer used exposive devices to create chaos and cause panic.=Name: Gadget\nJoined the police on the 6th of September 2117 and worked in CSI and forensics. \nHe solved several important cases and was lauded as one of the most excellent detectives in Starlight City.\nOn 5th August 2126, Gadget was killed in an action regarding the Sculpture cases. He lost his life while trying to protect innocent civilians.\nThe police team are grieving for detective Gadget, and urge all police work together to catch the murderer so that Gadget didn't die for nothing.=In the last meeting, Viktor and various other participants decided that the likelihood of the murderer returning to Starlight City is very small, and that the police force should be properly prepared in neighboring areas. However, following our investigations my partner and I believe there is more at work here than meets the eye.=WE'VE CAUGHT A BREAK\nThere were 1766 test targets in this old experiment, and only 157 targets survived. There are 41 descendants of the survivors and only 11 of them have remained genetically stable after three generations.\nLooking at the Sculpture murders, so far the victims were all female, and if we exclude the ones who only have male descendants, the ones left are...all ancestors of the serial murder victims.\nAnd the last one is...\n\nJohn Totti, special investigator of the Intelligence Agency, who died during a drug case.\nSon: Viktor Totti\nDaughter: Lena Totti\n...\nPS: Lena Totti is currently studying at St. Loster Girl's College in the Musu Zone, Starlight City.=Reinforced Gene Experiment Code 1887 Classification level: Top-secret\n"...The experiment to reinforcing the intelligence of the test targets through genetic modification have been successful! However, it's a shame that there is a high chance of sequela among the descendants of the test targets in this experiment. The descendants will develop diseased organ collapse because of the incomplete inheritance from the modification of chromosome genetic sequences [3p3,5] [3p62.1] [4p1,13] [5p21.4] [6p2.3]. The test targets of Reinforced Gene Experiment 1887 have a genetic sequence that will respectively affect the pancreas, throat, liver, kidneys and skin. Suppose the missing organ in the Arthur Fory Town case was the pancreas, then the order of missing organs in the later murder cases matches the order of the genetic sequence. The murderer is highly likely to be a descendant who kills to replace his diseased organs with the normal organs of the victims. Only descendants of the test targets can meet his requirements.\nThe skin peeling in the fifth case was a small amount, and it is far from enough as once the skin starts to develop symptoms it will expand to the whole body. The fifth case is very likely to be just a trial to get the skin, and the murderer is going to kill again in order to get the complete skin.=The replaced organs, proven through evidence from the Reinforced Gene Experiment 1887, based on all previous cases.=The file of the High Sea Cruise case=Time=01.09.2127=International Waters=High Sea Cruise=The AED board decided to throw a celebration party following a monumental breakthrough in the lastest research of the new chip. The party was arranged on the luxurious cruise ship "High Sea" belonging to the company president.\nAll board members of AED were killed in the private conference room onboard the ship.\n According to witness reports and the crime scene investigation, board members and administrative personnel of AED company were killed during the celebration party.\n The murder happened on a cruise ship in international waters, and ship staff didn't notice anything abnormal and nothing unusual was captured by the on-site monitor system.\nTechnicians later found the conference room monitor had been modified by the murderer and had been showing a pre-recorded loop, under cover of which the murderer killed everyone in the conference room.\n At the time when the ship was found, 41 people, including people from AED and ship crew, had been killed.\n Some body parts of the dead were arranged with servant robots into a sculpture of the "Messenger of Garden", and a large ceremony set-up was marked out at the bottom of the sculpture with blood.\nApart from the body parts that were made into the sculpture, all bodies were cleaned with water and placed carefully on the deck. The liver of one body was confirmed missing after the investigation.=Missing organ: <color%3D#7d0000>liver</color>=Note:The murderer is believed to be a skilled hacker, which is something not noticed in previous cases. In this regard he may be self-taught. \nIn 2125 the government decided to invest in robot riot police, and AED won the contract. At the time when the new chip was about to be completed, all board members were killed. Afterwards, AED was purchased by IQM, which is now believed to be closely involved in the case.=01.04.2127=Score Hotel " Sculpture" Case=Score Hotel South New Sinow of St. Bix Sate=The family of four that was holiday were killed and mutilated in the hotel room. Some body parts were made into a sculpture of the King of White Wings. \nCrime scene investigation records: \nThe murderer followed the wife who went back to the room herself and killed and mutilated her. Her body was made into a "sculpture". Husband returned to the room early with two children (11-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl) after getting the wife's text message.\nThe three victims were killed and mutilated in a similar way, part of the bodies were sewed together with the body parts of the first victim to make the sculpture.\nNote:\nSimilar to the Singer Sculpture Murder case and High Sea Cruise case, there was no fingerprint or other identity information left at the crime scene.\nThe left kidney of the grown-up woman and the right kidney of the girl were not found at the scene.=Missing organ: <color%3D#7d0000>kidney</color>=18.06.2127=Carbon Prison, More and Norse Coastal Cape=Carbon Prison Sculpture=Victim: Maria Gender: Female \nWitness: Smith Gender Male \nBoth the victim and the witness are prison police officers.\nThe witness entered Cell Block C to find the victim as she was late for the shift change. The witness found the victim and several prisoners killed and mutilated mercilessly.\n The murderer destroyed a prison service robot violently and made it into a sculpture of the "Twig of Birch" with the mutilated body parts of the dead. CSI later noted skillful technique was used. The witness then sounded the prison alarm. \nThe monitoring system failed to notice anything or anyone suspicious, and neither did the other prisoners. \nLike the previous cult Sculpture cases, nothing related to the murderer's identity was found at the crime scene. The police are still investigating how the murderer entered the prison, committed the crime and escaped without detection.=Note 1：The Special Mission Squad believes that the murderer is very familiar with the prison environment and the monitored areas. This suggests he could have worked at or been incarcerated in the prison before, but there is no further progress in the investigation so far.=Note 2：According to the forensic experts, skin peelings were found on the deceased's chest in this case.=2127.9.27\n5:20A.M.\nMoving to destination.\n8:17A.M.\nArriving at destination.\n11:03A.M.\nCan hear explosions coming from the location where the main force is being lead by Viktor.

Upon investigation, sweat and soluble cells were found. According to this, the person seems to be without an external skin layer, resulting in residual dissolving cells on the mask. Experts assume this is the result of gene mutation.\nThe DNA of this person doesn't match anything in known gene pools, to the point where it's difficult to even call the creature human.=Fantasy Jellyfish Bar - staff passage way=Fantasy Jellyfish Bar - the wine cellar=Fantasy Jellyfish Bar - secret chamber=News=Notes=Starlight City=Main Tasks=Side Tasks=There are still side tasks unfinished:=Quit current task and go to the next scene?=You haven't acquired this file yet!=1 Put in an instruction=2 test the device=3 inject <No.3 Experiment liquid>=Inputting orders...\n>.32 00 ID 20 CD 91 7D\n>.54 00 01 00 25 00 32\n>.69 00 6E 00 33 00 32\nOrder entered.

I need to provide a power source to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the bridge control station</color> and the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Morse signal light</color>.=Is there a problem with the engine? Let's see here... The pressure meter isn’t working, it must be broken.=The engine is structurally fine, and as for the pressure meter... it might work again if <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the bellows</color> and <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>flange base</color> are replaced.=I've got to find a way to fix the pressure meter.=This robot has gone into permanent hibernation because its core energy source is used up. He has a charging microprocessor on his body, which is really helpful.=There is a LED light here, which seems to work with an accumulator. If this light is turned on, everything in this cabin can be viewed clearly.=This is a room card from <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the Scott Hotel murder</color>. <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> disguised himself as hotel staff to gain access to the room, then..the bunny puppet in the first package belonged to one of the victims.=Looks like the room number is <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the password</color> to open the container up there. Now go and have a look. I wonder what is waiting for me there.=Part of cable has been cut off, so I'll need to replace it.=The door is locked tight, and it can only be opened from inside. This is bad.=The charging device for the accumulator is not connected to a power source. It can only work when the cabin power supply is running normally.=This looks like the back-up generator for the ship. If there is <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>a recharger, the accumulator can be recharged</color> through the outside interface.=If a normal pressure meter is installed, this fuel engine will start.=I can't see it clearly, but this robot is likely an engineering model. There might be something useful on him. I need to light up this place and look most closely.=Now the accumulator can be recharged.=There should be a pressure circuit board in this device, but I can't dismantle it until I light this place up.=This is the device that controls the transmission power, but it's too dark to see it clearly. I need to light up this place first.=A puppet? Looks like a new trick.=A room card? 1023... Wait! This is the missing room card from the case of the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Scott Hotel</color>. <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> used it to get in the room then...=Is it locked? Judging from the structure of this boat, this door should lead to the storage room.=Yes, I remember the guy with the mask left something in there. Why don't you go around through another path to have a look at it.=Can you stop popping up like that? You scared the shit out of me!=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> seems to have hidden something in there, but the door is locked, so I'll need to find another way in.=Looks like this is the key to open the containers up there. Let's go up there. Maybe there are other surprises for me.=The boat’s power has been completely restored, and now power can be distributed to more devices simultaneously.=The same system should open this door, and there seems to be unsent signals.=I’ve cracked the puzzle you left me. Now let's see what exactly it is you’re trying to do.=It looks like the weight on this side is insufficient, and the switch doesn't have enough power to raise the lift.=I knew it! This is the switch to start the boat transmitter. There are two signals left, let's see what's gonna happen.=All three of the signal groups have been sent, and the bridge to receive the signals has lit up. It seems to be working. The entrance to the terminal seems to be at the turbine wheels. I'll go have a look.=It looks like the weight on this side is insufficient, and the switch doesn't have enough power to raise the lift.=This is a very dangerous operation. I should stop the transmission first.=This is the departure spot for all the "raw materials". It looks like we're getting closer to the truth.=It's so dark in here, I can't see a thing.=The pressure resistant flange base on the lazy arm still looks new.=A cable wire, with a new protector.=The fuel stored is still sufficient, and there are lines of alloy wave tubing between the tube sheets of the cooling chips.=I can hear the sound of running gears behind this closed door.=The fuel motor is running to provide energy for the boat.=These Xenon searchlights were phased out 60 years ago. Besides lighting, it can send signals when used with the boat siren.=This is a device that controls the direction of the gears, but it is not running due to a lack of energy source.=A puppet hang upside down, made with lots of broken robot parts. Is this what the "Hugo Card" predicted?=The clues point to the last logistics hub, and the murderer didn't even try to cover his tracks.=This device not only controls the transmission's forward and reverse movement, but also starts and stops it. But it needs more power before it can work.=The sonar control station can be used to check on previously sent spectrums, once connected to power.=The control panel is powered off, and it has to be connected to the power to input the signals on the graphs.=A room card from <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Scott Hotel</color>, with blood stains on it.=The power transmission chain is not connected, so the lifting platform can't move.=Something is blocking the path.=The elevating platform has reached the highest point.=The elevating platform has reached the lowest point.=A Hugot card named "Invert Float", but the body in it is on fire, maybe it is an implies something.=I just passed by <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the last logistic hub</color>. I need to double check this.=You have to increase the counter-weight to elevate the lift.=This is the first mate’s navigation log. Will there be anything interesting?=Don't touch that navigation log!=This is awful! Changing the equipment on the Destiny Fire, making a mess on my ship and now reading my first mate's diary?=An AR projection? This looks like an old style sailing assistant AI... Are you the captain of this ship?=If you’re with the guy in the bird mask, get lost!=The bird mask? No, I’m here to arrest him. Do you know where he is?=My navigation range only covers the area near the Destiny Fire, so I can't say whether he’s here or not.=That weirdo added something to the ship's system, so you'd better catch him soon. He is not allowed on my ship again!=So much for a bedside manner, eh?=Normally AIs would be wiped once a ship is abandoned, or they would escape into cyberspace, but she’s been here all this time. She must have a strong attachment to the ship.=So... I'm on a ship at the bottom of the dirtiest, dankest district in Starlight City in search of a key to a crate that just nearly killed me. This must be the bridge. Let's search around for clues.=What? Inputting sound wave failed? It looks like the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>fog light signal-receiving device</color> is not working normally.=It's too dark ahead, I shouldn't go any further.=Sonar sensor can't work without power.=The sonar sensor is now working normally, so I can check out the received spectrum at the control station on the bridge.=The lighting circuit is cut off. It can be fixed if there is a long enough cable.=This is the equipment to control <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the lighting and power supply</color> of the whole ship.=Ever since my night vision function got busted, it's been a pain in the ass carrying out case investigations in dark areas.=It's so dark in here, I can't see a thing.=An old engineering robot that probably died from a nuclear power leakage.=An old engineering robot that probably died from a nuclear power leakage.=The parts to repair the pressure meter have been collected, now I need to find a workbench to repair it.=The pressure meter is working, I can restart the fuel generator by adjusting it to the proper pressure.=A rusty fog horn, with no structural problems.=I need to get past this coded lock to gain access to the machine.=The crane control room. There is no need to use it again.=Ugh...wherever I go, I meet locks. If I unlock the dot matrix, I can control this equipment.=Looks like the second group of signals can be successfully sent.=The entrance to the secret path has been found and there is no need to use it again.=The device is offline right now. Unable to distribute power!=Insufficient power remaining!=Long time no see, detective.=This is what I saw in my hallucination before. So many dead bodies... It seems that <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>’s experiments have never stopped.=Ever since that unlabeled parcel at the beginning of this journey, <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> has been laying a trap to bring me in deeper and deeper. What could he want?=The sculpture in the square was just to open the eyes of the local gangs, but that hallucination was a message left especially for me.=So many lives have been sacrificed just to lead me here...=This is it. It ends right here, right now.=All the "raw materials" were indeed delivered form here. <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> led me all the way to here, so he must have planned something more. I need to look around... very carefully.=The provocative tone of this message...combined with the use of explosives...it's definitely <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>! Does "murderer" refer to himself? No, it must be the man who made the sculpture.=Sure enough, someone made the statue under <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s guidance. <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> has confirmed it with this message.=This pawn is of no further value for <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>. Knowing his temper, Noa won't keep a worthless follower around...=Is this... <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Dr. Edward</color>!!!=Congratulations! The murderer is captured.=The murderer is dead, and cannot answer for his crimes. However, I have helped Mr. Detective and made him confess. It was he who kidnapped the robot innocents and conducted terrible experiments.=But these were not his worst crimes, his worst crime was going against my will!=Come to the place where the voice of the past resides. I'm looking forward to our long awaited reunion!=If this note is correct, then the missing Underbridge robots were indeed the work of the doctor, and Nanco was right.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> and Dr. Edward seem to have been working together for a long time. The doctor must have played an important role in making the Nano fluid and implanting devices to manipulate robots.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>, having abandoned the doctor at this stage suggests that his plan is almost complete. But the doctor seems to have been killed last night, so this means somebody else made the sculpture?=The doctor was killed, which means <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> has finished his plan. That psycho! Why is he doing this? Implant devices and Nano robots... He surely is up to something even crazier than what he did thirteen years ago.=There's nothing else for me to do except dance to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s tune. Maybe then he will reveal himself. What's next? Making the signal receiver work properly.=Doctor Edward is hung in the container, with most of his rear body missing. Internal organs have been placed outside the ribs, and eyeballs pulled out of the sockets. He must have endured unbelievable pain before he died.=This gear transmission chain is connected directly to the cabin up there, and only by operating it correctly can we receive the signals from the searchlight from the other side.=The indicator light is green, so this transmission chain should be running normally, and now all we need to do is to send the correct signals to the cabin up there.=It's stuck? Maybe the direction wrong, I should try to reverse it.=A specially made code lock...This must have been installed for a good reason. Based on what he does, he would have left a clue somewhere. We need to pay attention during investigation.=A Morse signal light, which can emit communication signals with the fog horn system.=The Morse signal light beams to the bridge of the abandoned ship on the opposite side.=Congratulations! The murderer is captured.\nThe murderer is dead, and cannot answer for his crimes. However, I have helped Mr. Detective and made him confess. It was he who kidnapped the robot innocents and conducted terrible experiments.\nBut these are not his worst crime, his worst crime was going against my will!=An old engineering robot that probably died from a nuclear power leakage.=The control terminal below is not open and cannot be operated.=Oh shit, I almost got hit there. Another of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>'s tricks. Wait, what's that on the container?=Wait, this container has been modified by someone, if this was left by <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color> on purpose, the "key" that opens it must be somewhere close by.=The opposite deck is a complete mess. A large number of gears can been seen through the windows, and they look like they were recently installed.=This device seems to be able to change the transmission route of the gears. The gears on the left seem to be connected to the cabin above, and the gears on the right should control the lift next to it.=Water... Always falling. The sound hurts my ears. Thanks to you, I feel awful whenever I hear the sound of rain.=But if you’ve made it all the way here, it means those little gifts before got your attention. You truly are the dogged, driven detective Rex.=Did you see the container I lovingly prepared for you? The criminal you are looking for is right inside.=But that was just a short prelude. The real game has only just begun. Can you find the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>sound</color> I left behind before your life finally comes to an end?=He's here! I knew it! He intentionally mentioned <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>sound</color> as a clue for me. But who is the criminal he is talking about? Could it be the guy who made the sculpture?=The equipment on this abandoned ship is still working. That's a good place to start.=The equipment is intact, but some of these rusty parts need to be replaced.=This system can be used to control a combination of Morse signal lights and foghorn signals.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>The fog light</color> has been turned off, and no sound wave signals can be put in.=This is a log of yesterdays recorded signals, which were sent just before the delivery logistics hub was used.=The three graphs on the record are "sound" clues that have been left behind intentionally. There must be a way to reproduce them...=Sonar graph records have captured the sounds sent by the fog horn. The fog horn and Morse signal light work together when boats are communicating, and Morse code is used for information delivery.=The Morse signal light is needed to send a signal from the ship. And the object the Morse signal light shines on...=Is this the control room of another ship? I need to go have a look. Maybe there are more switches.=The Morse signal light has been intentionally blocked by a box, so I'll need to move it. The crane above should help.=What a stupid game! But I guess that's right in line with what I'd expect from you. <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Noa</color>... Let's finish this once and for all.=It looks like I have to make sure the whole Morse signal light and fog horn systems are working before proceeding to the next step.=There's only emergency power left on this boat, so I'll need to go down to the power room to restart the generator if possible.=What? Inputting sound wave failed? It looks like the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>fog light signal-receiving device</color> is not working normally.=It seems that the transmission chain is affecting the cabin above.=Is that light sending morse code? The message is..."A S". Waiting? Is it waiting for someone to signal back?=This is the power distribution controller, but all that's left is emergency power. I'll check the power cabin later. Let's see if there's any other equipment.=The receiving cabin suddenly lit up, so it's definitely having some effect. I should send out the rest of the signals.=Okay, that's all three. I better head over to the receiving cabin, it seems like there's some activity over there.=Aha! This is the electrical control centre. Let's see... There's only emergency power left on this boat, so I'll need to restart the generator if possible.=These three Sonar graphs were recorded recently, it may be useful to record them first.=The sonar device has been deactivated, so the Sonar graph can't be viewed.=Control Centre=Control Centre=Lighting of the Ship and Pass Way=Morse Signal Light=Sonar=Entertainment Room=Maintenance Room=Storage Room=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>A broken device</color>=Where's this stray cat from? Go away!=Can’t you see we’re in the middle of a turf war with this stupid dog? Cats from other families shouldn’t be here.=This gear transmission chain leads to the cabin up there, could it be...=These gear groups were built for easier shipping and dismantling of deserted boats, but the guy with the mask must have altered them for some purpose.=The cabin up there does have something to do with the searchlight on the other side. It looks like we have to make the transmission chain run normally in order to receive the searchlight signal in the cabin.=Looks like you're not quite as stupid as I thought... I noticed that every time he tested the searchlight up there, a green light will shine here.=Yes, when these gear groups are connected correctly to the cabin up there, the <color%3D#64FF47FF>green</color> light will shine, which is a very useful clue.=I'm only helping you because I want that guy to leave my ship alone!=What? A robot corpse? Was he the Scavenger?=He used to be the engineer for this boat, but he became a wanderer after this place was closed down, and he sometimes talked to me. He stopped moving after his internal core started to leak a couple of years ago, so you'd better leave him as he is.=Do you not like other people coming onto this ship?=He knows the beauty of the Destiny Fire better than you do. You humans only care about the next big thing. Flash cars flying through Sky City...=Bloody Candlestick=A candlestick with lots of blood stains. This must be the lethal weapon from Mrs. Perry's murder case.=Green Biocat=AR Captain=亲爱的店主您好：\n怪盗量子面相敬上，我将在明天偷走你最贵重的东西，为了更加有趣，我为你留下了小小的提示，希望这个标志会让你想起什么，提前做好准备哦。=《绯闻奶奶》《黑猫侦探》《桃子郡女孩》《我爱杰克》《六米之上》《Z档案》，这年头纸质漫画已经很少见了。=几种颜色怪异的人工合成食材正在便当机里翻涌着。=扫码式饮料机，巧克力咖喱味可乐、热海带味苹果汁、麻辣火锅味红茶、黄油味矿泉水......奇怪的口味。=大部分都是合成牛奶，连小猫都不会喝。=速食便当，有很大一部分是从那台便当机里生产出来的，还是不要尝试了。=《安珀志》《三体》《基地》《沙丘》系列图书......摆满了早期科幻故事的书架。=低温冷藏的机器人用关节油补充剂和芯片板清洁喷雾。=三明治和咖喱饭的保质期都写着今天。=货架上堆满了自热火锅和自热米饭。真是伟大的发明，据说起源于21世纪初期。=诱人的速食便当宣传图，图片仅供参！图片仅供参！图片仅供参！=调料柜存在的意义是：调料自取，餐具自取，不要打扰店长。=一副漂亮的彩虹文身图。=我爸爸很喜欢彩虹，他曾是个雇佣兵，但是退役后的战争后遗症一直折磨着他，有一天他离开家后就再也没有回来。=虽然所有人都不理解他为什么会选择去桥下区开始新的生活，但我知道爸爸已经找到了内心的平静。=这幅彩虹就是为了纪念他而创作的，他常说：往前走，乌云后总会出现彩虹。=一副漂亮的彩虹文身图。=一副月亮的纹身图。=前几天有一个紫色头发的女人想要纹这个，她说自己的丈夫似乎一直把她当做了什么人的替代品。=所以她想要一个文身来证明，她就是独一无二的自己。我还记得，她的名字就和月亮相关，就叫......=一副月亮的纹身图，宁静而清冷。=一副造型奇特的钥匙卡片，这上面是量子密匙吗？=这可是有名的“怪盗量子面相”的预告函，他每次在盗取宝物前都会给主人提前寄上卡片，然后在主人的戒备下盗走宝物。=这张卡片可是怪盗量子面相在那次“梦幻白龙芯片”被盗事件中寄来的卡片。现在很多年轻人喜欢把他的标志文在身上。=怪盗量子面相的预告函卡片，画有标志性的量子钥匙。=便当原料采买清单：\n1.土豆5kg\n2.南瓜2kg\n3.西红柿1kg\n4.生菜3kg（需要有机的）\n......\n

Is this a complaint letter? From the Quantum Face? The weird theft?=Is the most valuable item this lunch box machine? What does this sign mean?=What sign? I haven't seen it before. It must be some naughty boy from nearby. I wouldn't be afraid even if it were the weird thief Quantum Face himself. All he wants is my lunch box machine anyway.=Maybe I can use this as an excuse to raise the price of my lunch boxes, as even the weird thief Quantum Face wants to steal my lunch boxes.=Right, I have upgraded the seasoning system of my machine. Do you want to try my new flavor?=I'll pass. Everyone knows how terrible the meal boxes from your machine are.=I don't care whether it taste good or not as long as I can make money out of it. I would never go back to the old days when I had to get up early to make lunch boxes myself. I was exhausted back then.=He thinks he could steal my precious meal box machine. Bring it on. I don't care if he's the Phantom Thief or not. I'll show him how courageous I am!="Industrial delicacies made with culinary craftsmanship! Fast food meal boxes coming soon!" That's an great poster for your fast food meal boxes.=Well, it's nice, isn't it? I designed it myself for my new meal boxes.=So you know how to design posters? The picture looks good. As for the flavors...=I started this shop from scratch all by myself. I even installed wall tiles myself when I decorated the place. Are you sure you don't wanna try a meal box?=save it for yourself!=Which flavor of yogurt should I choose?=Ano's got really weak stomach, so let's get him a natural yogurt.=Hey, young man, are you getting a yogurt? This brand is great, made from natural milk, and it is on sale lately.=You know what? I found a secret of Doctor Wondertles in this book. The real baddie in his 18th adventure is the Sibourg dog head worm.=The comics?=Limited collector's edition. I found this treasure just now in a gap underneath the comic book shelf. You must have heard of him. Dr. Wonder Tales is an icon for an entire generation.=I think I have heard about it. Wonder Tales... that adventurer?=Yes. I'm a loyal member of the Dr. Wonder Tales Research Association. I can tell you some of his classic stories. You don't want to miss out on them.=What do you want to hear?=The treasure of Dr. Wonder Tales=Doctor's assistant Coconut=The Sword of Gram=I don't want to hear it now=Dr. Wonder Tales gathered a lot of treasures during his adventures. To inspire more people to start their own adventures, Dr. Wonder Tales hid his treasures all over the world.=You can only get the treasures by cracking his riddles. It is said that he left behind a mysterious surprise "meet the idol" for each treasure.=This assistant monkey of the Doctor first made his appearance in the third chapter of "The Crazy Adventures of Doctor Wonder Tales".=Upon opening a coffin in a Sumatran temple, Dr. Wonder Tales found a black-tailed monkey wearing a golden crown sleeping inside the coffin. Doctor named the little fella "Coconut".=The two left their footprints all over the world. New adventures always rose wherever they ventured together.=This sword is from one of Dr. Wonder Tales' four most legendary adventures, from the comic book "Dr. Wonder Tales and the Polar Sword".=Dr. Wonder Tales fought 20 mechanical snow wolves on a snowfield. During the fight, he was distracted by the magical voices of 3 electronic sirens.=However, he managed to defeat that snake-shaped robot -- which was over 10 meters long -- in the end, and pulled the Gram Sword out of its heart.=This sword might look humble and even has a broken hilt, it motivates its user's innermost convictions. I even have a miniature figure of it at my place.=If you want, I can tell you more stories anytime. Stories about Dr. Wonder Tales are always full of adventures. He's a true legend.=I can tell you more about Coconut next time, he was extraordinary monkey.=Head, a bowl of ramen please! No, I mean, shop manager, a bowl of ramen please.=Your ramen is ready.=Wow, with two extra slices of braised pork. You really don't plan to go back?=I'm just a restaurant owner now, even if my scarred face still reminds people that I once defeated the four kings of the Underbridge District with just a butterfly knife.=Okay, but please come see me in rainbow Club!=Ramen here tastes as great as always. Boss now looks like a different person from the "Red-haired Yasha" he used to be.=Eh, those bullshit energy bill...made my Destiny Burning...eh...ended my life on the sea, the blue sea, my ship...=Whooo, my beautiful captain...Eh, my gentle captain...=Eh, why is everything moving? I must be in my ship! My captain...=There are more and more artificial food, my teacher used to make fish soup with real sea fish, but now you can only get half-machinery monster.=Right, did I tell you how I got the scar?=I have heard it many times. You got the scar when battling with the gang leader "ghost dragonfly" from the neighboring city.=That was a rumor. I actually got the scar when I saved the important lady of the Bellflower House from 30 gang members of the Blue Dragon.=I did get a scar, but I defeated the whole gang.=Shush! That was an old story, and please do not mention it to anyone...Well, if you happen to tell the story to someone, don't mention the part where I got a kiss from the lady.=Don't spread rumors. I'm just a cook at a ramen restaurant, not some "Red-haired Yasha" who used to dominate the Underbridge District. Yeah, red-haired, not yellow-haired. Keep that in mind.=It's rare that a human restaurant serves food for robots. Maybe it's because the owner is from the Underbridge District. He treats all of us alike.=He's a good cook. That big bowl of electrolyte soup soothed my circuits and saved me from a long day.=Your words are making me hungry again. I'm gonna order some take-out silicon wafer balls.=I hope the manager can put more robots' food on the menu.=This ramen shop is awesome. I can never get such food in Sky City. I am getting tired of the organic food up there.=Next stop is, let's see... Miracle Street. Hmm, it's curious that people up there all recommended this place after they heard that I was coming down to ground level.=I should have come down here earlier. Everything here fascinates me.=Leave me alone. I'm trying to capture signals from Lark the God of Destiny. I'm not here for ramen. It's just that this restaurant is where the signals aggregate.=Huh!? This signal,beep, beep beep, beep, If cracked in Morse code, it means" Please choose Sophit laundry liquid"?=Maybe the antenna is tilted. Is Lark telling me to buy a few bottles of laundry detergent? Possible... Those are buy one, get one free at the supermarket.=I have to go to the supermarket, following the holly message from the God of Destiny Lark.=That poor guy. The real soul can never be copied. It is called consciousness copy, but in reality it is nothing more than an illusion made by copied data.=That puppy doesn’t’t exist anymore when it died. His owner may know this, but he is not willing to face up to the fact.=I think I saw you somewhere yesterday. You look interested in my service.=Clone, consciousness copy, memory extension...I take all these tasks. Shush! Here's my name card. Call me.=Those who want to copy consciousness should cherish what they have instead of clinging to the past by copying what they're afraid to lose...=Wait. If people think like you, how am I going to keep my business going? Go finish your work after lunch.=You are here again today. These guys just don't believe me. Tell them that my scar was left from the fight where I battled with three riot robots all by myself to guard the whole Underbridge Area.=You told me a different story yesterday though. Why are you blinking at me? Oh, right, I got it, you were hurt trying to save a little girl from the three robots.=If not for her, you could have taken those iron heads down in a second.=All of my long-time customers will tell you the same. Go ask around. See who the "Red-haired Yasha" was back then. But don't get any ideas, I'm just a ramen restaurant owner now.=I am just a ramen maker. What's in the past should be left in the past.=I don't think it is a crime committed by robots. Under the three principles, there must have been some misunderstanding.=There are so many different versions of Mrs. Perry's case, and I have heard at least 5 stories. I saw her a lot when I was feeding the cats, and she seemed such a nice person.=Let's mourn for Mrs. Perry. But... this happening before the election makes me think there's something more to this case.=Looks like I am going to feed the cats alone.=Robots can't injure human beings. That's written in their source code.=The company is trying to find some new girl to take over "Bird tail", but no one is suitable after two months of hunting.=Take a look at the conditions the company is asking for: She should have a retro feeling, hair tied up into a bum, has a hard past that can cause a sensation at the right time. It is so hard to be a star hunter.=After this drink, I'm gonna take a walk out there. Maybe I'll run into tomorrow's next rising star.=Yesterday's note was probably some kid's prank. But I've put some extra precautions in place, just in case.=These chains... You said you didn't care, didn't you?=It was a mail from the Weird Theft Quantum Face any way. Being cautious doesn’t hurt, and...=What's that? Is the power gone again?=Haha, I heard someone talking about me!=Hi,shop owner, I am here as I have informed you. Mr. Detective Rex, fancy seeing you here. You cannot help though because I am too good to be stopped.=Weird Theft Quantum Face! Rex, save my lunch box machine!=Oh, sorry, it looks like the thing I want has been thrown away by the shop owner. What a shame.=What?! The poster. I just put it there and now it's gone!=My lunch box machine, my lunch box machine. Hahaha, it is still here. The weird thief failed this time! The chain worked.=My shopping list from way back then...when I saved up just enough money to buy this broken convenience store. Place was tiny, but I was passionate about making meal boxes every day.=Why is there a piece of useless paper here. Is this...=Even this shopping list was stuffed into the back of the poster. I outsourced the entire production of meal boxes. I even forgot about the trademark that I designed myself.=so...=I designed the logo myself, but later...earning money became my only target. I renovated the whole shop.=I hid the shopping list behind the poster, I outsourced my lunch box making, and I even forgot the logo I designed.=A robot tattoo? That is rare. I don't see many robots getting a tattoo. Aren't the parts of your body changed once in a while. There is no point getting a tattoo.=I want to remember what's important for me. I want to feel the pain human feel when getting a tattoo done.=There is no pain-sensing machine on the external shell of a robot, so if you want to feel the pain, you need to install a sensing simulation device.=You can go to the repair shop at the corner and get a simulator there. But make sure you bargain with the owner, he likes to overcharge.=I will go get one now.=Why are you here? I don't see any more place for a tattoo on you.=The tattoos from before are all gone. The majority of my body has been replaced by mechanical parts.=So, do you want a tattoo for your mechanical parts?=Are you not going to ask me what I have gone through? This is typical "Lydsia style".=It's pointless to ask. I just feel sorry for my masterpieces - you lost them. I put in a lot of work on those tattoos.=What a shame! The tattooed body has been replaced by mechanical parts. Never mind, I was just practicing when I did those ones on you.=Don't focus on the area where you're getting tattooed. It only hurts more. Let's talk about why you're getting this name tattoo. Who's Anta?=Emmm, this hurts. This is the name of my lifesaver. I was once locked up in a sweat factory in the desert. I was forced to work everyday. Ouch, it hurts!=Anta was my only friend. Eventually, he helped me get out of there, but he... I want to honor Anta. It's he who gave me the courage to live.=I don't know you had a past like that.=I will go back to that factory one day to free all the robots. One day...The pain I am feeling today is nothing compared to the pain I was feeling then.=Moew bullo, moew buloo ka! Moew---Wait, is the one looking for an answer is here?=Who is behind the curtain?=I am the "telepathy master. I answer your questions.=Talk to the "Psychic Master" in the strange clothes?=Talk to him.=You look different from the cats I met. Are you an astrologist? Like the humans who wear pointed hats?=Young man, it is a great manner to have an awe towards mysterious things. I can predicate the future, and I can see people's destiny.=En. Sounds like you do have some skills. Can you do a fortune telling for me? I am actually very interested in occultism.=I can see your future without fortune telling. You will be a wanderer for a few years, and you will find a female cat, who gives birth to couple of kittens and you will live your life in some attic.=Is that my cat life?=I don't believe your bullshit.=An old man who talks crazy stuff?=Yong man, show me some respect. I can easily put bad luck on you. I can a famous "telepathy master".Even Don Vigor came to me to see destiny.=I don't believe you. You can't do anything like that. There's no psychic stuff here, just endless trouble, twisted like a yarn ball.=You are being rude! I will ask you to pay a price for what you said. Let's see your pathetic future. Moew bullo no fish, moew bullo no herbs, wooloowooloo...=You are the...! You are a combination of artificial creation and natural creation, very unstable. You should not have been born. Don't come here. This is a vicious sign!=What on earth happened?=I only predict an unseen future, but your future is all written.=No,no,no, I should never take a peek, it is horrible.

This is a... a giant underground factory, which seems to have been abandoned a long time ago...=This path is blocked by fungi. Better stay away from it.=I have never seen this kind of fungus before. The mushroom umbrella looks like a balloon, it’s so thin, it looks like it might... what!?=The slightest shock is enough to set off these fungi. I wonder whether these spores can do anything.=Inhale these spores if you want to die. These fungi have been exposed to nuclear waste, so their spores are full of poison. You see a lot when you're attached to a ship for years with nothing to do...=Could you give me a warning before you just appear? Seems like you’re familiar with this place.=I am an AI with access to a database so massive you couldn't even imagine. This was an underground factory during the Human Robot War, long forgotten by time. Be careful: several entries warn of creatures sighted in the depths.=These kinds of abandoned factories remind me of Noa's old hideouts. He liked building bases deep in the world's dark places.=No ones knows how long this underground factory has been abandoned. It’s been completely overrun by fungi.=Fluid drips from this discarded tank. It has a strong smell... like a combustion aid. Is it an isobutyl lithium complex?=The way down is completely blocked by fungi. How can I get rid of it?=Ha! The flaming bottles set off the fungi spores! Looks like the toxic fog is going to hang around for a while, though. What's your plan?=You seem to enjoy seeing me in trouble. I have to get rid of this spore fog.=I am not enjoying it. Make good use of the tube behind you, the steam coming out of it can disperse the fog quickly.=Blow the fog away... classic.=The spore fog is too dense, I can't go down.=I can’t unscrew it. Looks like I need professional tools to turn this valve.=Nothing happened. It looks like this tube is still blocked. I need to figure out a way to direct the air from inside the workshop into this tube.=The fog has been driven away. Now I can go down.=beep~beep~beep~=The badge activated again? This must be the right way, just follow the signal.=These radioactive fungi will explode if disturbed and give off a huge amount of poisonous gas.=Abandoned tanks. The fluid inside was used to make bombs during the Human Robot War.=There is poisonous spore fog everywhere over there. Stay away from it.=There is nothing but fungi and abandoned equipment ahead.=Killed in one blow, I wonder whether it was another worker or an enemy insurgent...=Looks like you have found an abandoned operating room. But everything is broken here. A "trash dump" you humans would call it.=From my experience, you should never underestimate trash.=Come to think of it, you made lots of tools with the trash on my ship, Mr. Junk Collector.=I thought you were absolutely in love with the Destiny Fire, and now you are calling it trash?=I can call it trash, but no one else can.=This main tube leads directly outside, but no air is coming through it. Other tubes must be channeling the air.=This broken emergency light might come in handy.=It says main valve on the handle. It seems like it can unscrew the outside valve.=This tube channels the steam. I need a valve to turn off the steam transmission.=Looks like the air has been directed into the main tube. Let's go have a look.=Let's find Charles first. It's not the time to go back yet.=What is a holographic message doing in a place like this? It must have been left by Noa. What the hell is he up to?=A long, rambling paragraph full of contradictions. He is getting crazier.=Eh?! Where did that beep come from? Another hallucination?=Huh!? This place transformed into a kitchen... This is a hallucination, without a doubt. This scene is... the crime scene of the Alta State case, Noa's first ever murder. The start of all this evil.=The victims of this case were a housewife and two small-town robots. At the crime scene, the three were discovered to have been killed at the same time, and the body parts of the three were made into a combined body in the housewife's kitchen.=This combined body was the prototype for all the sculptures created afterwards. Noa was still a newbie at the time. But back to practical matters... Another hallucination means another signal projector. I should find it somehow.=This sculpture... There was no such thing at the original crime scene. Is it a human? Three holes, in the throat, abdomen and waist... Maybe I need to fill the holes to break through this hallucination.=Hmm... In all of Noa cases, organs of the victims were found missing.=Finding the three missing parts should be the key to breaking the hallucination.=The door is plastered with seals, and there seems to be absolutely nothing inside.=I am back at the first crime scene.=I need to put the recovered organs back into place.=Hallucination... gone, eh? The signal projector! Just like what I saw in the abandoned ship cabin. The hallucination didn’t just appear out of thin air, this is the device that's causing it!=It looks like the moment I entered this ventilation room, I fell into the hallucination created by Noa.=Noa made me see all the old crime scenes, for what?=A cupboard full of bowls, plates and baking tools, which is proof that the owner enjoyed life very much.=There is a commemorative plate of the couple's first wedding anniversary on top of the cupboard.=Her husband could not have guessed that what greeted him was not a warm dinner, but a vision of hell.=The black tea was still brewing on the stove when it happened, the boiling tea water overflowed and left a dark red stain on the table and floor.=The victim's old photos are still on the fridge, full of happiness, but everything is gone because of Noa.=The purification begins with this stubborn woman rejecting the fusion. \nShe is lucky to have her sins washed away so she can welcome Bson first. \nI shall lead the Vessel to bear the baptism of the four great sacrifices, and engrave the god's decree upon the body of the future. \nThe past ceremonies connect the souls, blessing all who witness Bson. \nIllusions connect our thoughts, electric waves guide the transmission, and when he realized the truth, the man in the mirror was no longer himself. \nMay you pass the final test, and I will be waiting for you in the depths of Light Lake.=How do you like the "memory album" I made especially for you? The two of us have had so many beautiful times together. I was hoping you could disrupt one of my plans, at least once. You really disappointed me.=You have finally shown your true colors, Noa. No more hiding?=Hiding? Hahaha! I have been planning something fun deeper underground, and I was thinking of inviting you, my old friend, to have a look. I don't know whether you can stop me this time, hahaha!=The damaged storage tank seems to have exploded from the inside.=Fungi broke this by growing wildly inside it and forcing their way out.=This door has been welded closed, but I can see some flickering light through the glass. What’s behind the door?=A firmly-welded iron door, which can't be opened by hands.=Noa has been using this device to give me hallucinations and it is still running. I need to get out of here fast.=A signal projector with implanted devices as the core, which can project hallucinatory signal waves.=The seal is gone. Where does this door lead to?=There are some traveling and baking photos on the fridge. The victim was quite popular in town, but she had something against Roverism, and was repeatedly found clashing with robot believers.=Wait! This... this is <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Sheryl's dressing room</color>! This is the crime scene where Noa committed the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Singer Sculpture Murder</color> on July 3rd, 2126.=The murderer killed Sheryl and her robot assistant, and made their bodies into the sculpture of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Bson the White</color> one hour before Sheryl was scheduled to go on stage.=Has Noa created this hallucination to re-live the crimes he committed? The hallucinations are becoming more and more clear. Is this because I’ve stayed in it too long? I have to break through Noa's maze fast.=A broken wine glass... According to the investigation, Sheryl had a habit of drinking before her shows.=There are lip prints on the glass. Sheryl's drink was also found at the crime scene. It contained 60% alcohol and some anaesthetic component. It's believed Noa put the anaesthetic in the drink.=A vintage record player, which Noa used to play the soundtrack of Sheryl's recent album, probably to cover up her screams.=The device doesn't play anymore. Probably the result of the witness hurrying out of the room and knocking it over.=I need to adjust the right texture, tone and pitch to reproduce Sheryl's voice. Let me try turning the knobs on the base.=This is Sheryl's voice. It was this recording that Noa used to buy himself some time to commit the crime. Sheryl's arrogance also assured Noa’s success: she allowed no one to interrupt her when she was alone.=That's why the staff waited until five minutes before the show to knock on her door, only to find the horrifying scene.=These bloodstained lace gloves were very important evidence. In addition to Sheryl's DNA, some dissolved skin tissue was found. The DNA of this skin tissue was very confusing. We concluded that the murderer suffered from a genetic disease characterized by decomposing skin.=Judging from the fact that the murderer wore the female singer's gloves, we deduced that the murderer might have had some kind of obsession with wearing their victims' clothing in order to become them.=The missing poster was something the police were searching for, but it was never found. When I saw it in Brank's place, I knew Noa was back.=Sheryl's lover would come visit her with a bouquet of flowers before every show. He was a successful man, and helped her quite a bit in her career.=People say Sheryl was hard to live with, but she was extremely gentle to her flower-bearing lover. After Sheryl's murder, he was completely broken, and would never be the same.=This is a sculpture of <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Bson the White</color>, one of the seven embodiments of Bson. Legend claims that Bson once turned himself into a poet wearing a white robe, and took away arrogant people's communicators, making it impossible for them to call for help. This sculpture stands for humility during communication.=The police only realized this was an embodiment of Bson when they saw the religious symbol Bson left at the crime scene. Noa, did you create all this just to make me appreciate your masterpieces one last time?=The sharp cries of the Arrogant must be cleared away. Bson cleaned up these stains before his arrival by using my hand. The singing voice of the sinners will live in me, so that I can praise the miracles of Bson.=Noa?! Stop your nonsense! All you ever wanted was to replace your diseased organs with the healthy ones stolen from your victims. You say Sheryl's arrogance killed her, but what crime did that robot assistant commit?=Sheryl's assistant suffered from her abuse, his humbleness a contrast to the singer's arrogance. I didn't kill anyone. I was just combining them. Human and robot, the arrogant and the humble, are merged into one under the will of Bson.=The investigator collected remains of the two bodies in the sculpture, and claimed to have retrieved every piece of Sheryl's body. However, I found subtle cutting marks on the neck, which are much finer than the rough cutting found on the rest of the sculpture.=By analysing the forensic records, I found Sheryl's throat missing, which everyone else neglected to notice.=Another door, another crime scene. Let's get this done.=A broken wine glass, whitch still contains a strong anaesthetic.=A gramophone that is playing Shirlo's songs. Although the songs are light and cheerful, the music hid the most terrible crime.=Rare hair accessories and jewelery, none of which was missing according to the police investigation.=Sheryl's gloves. In addition to Sheryl's DNA, another set of DNA was detected. However, the owner could not be identified, due to unusual hereditary genetic information.=High-end, custom tailored animal skin boots. Sheryl was criticized by the Animal Protection Association, but she didn't seem to care.=A cabinet full of performance clothing, made from every fabric imaginable.=A luxurious fur coat, an iconic outfit that was used in Sheryl's tour through northern countries.=A performance costume with terminal silicon chips, a gift from Sheryl's lover. The costume would create magnificent AR effects around Shirlo when she was on stage.=A sculpture that is made from the bodies of the victims. White Gown is one of Bson's 7 embodiments, and it stands for humbleness during communication. This image of Bson reminds followers to always be wary of their arrogance.=An unpublished classic poster of Sheryl, which was ripped down violently. It turned up again many years later at Brank's place.=Sweetheart, hope you break a leg!\nI will prepare a big celebration banquet on the roof of the company building for you, and my family will be there too, they can't wait to see you. I hope you wear the necklace I gave you last week. My driver will pick you up after the show.\n\n\nAlways yours, Christopher=A giant full-length mirror. I seem to have arrived here through it.=Who would have guessed that the person who sent this bouquet would end up like this.=A white bird erupts whenever I find a clue related to the case. I think that's it for this case. Are these white birds some sort of tally? Maybe something will happen now...=This stage... is the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>secret function room on a cruise ship</color>, the crime scene of the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>High Sea Cruise case</color> on the 29th of January, 2127. The senior officials were parading around robots and freaks when they were killed. It turned out Noa was the real headliner in this freak show.=This had the most victims among all of Noa's murder cases. Everyone - the performers and audience - was pieced together into a sculpture. The result was so gruesome that even the most stone-faced police officer was shaken to his core.=The stage is too dark, I can't see anything.=During this freak show, the audience wore bizarre masks, hiding their true identities so they could enjoy the sick and twisted performances.=There was one mask missing from the scene. Who would’ve guessed, many years later, the missing mask would turn up on Square Street.=Bson's symbol had been left on the mask wall. This was the first time Noa left this symbol at a crime scene. This clue made us realize that all the sculptures we found before were embodiments of Bson, which later led us to find out about Roverism.=This secret function room was equipped with a state-of-the-art ventilation system. The senior officials liked to add recreational drugs into the filtering system. Noa took advantage of this.=Done! Ah, the sweet smell of success. Investigators extracted some kind of poisonous nerve gas from the air filter net, explaining how Noa put more than 40 people down by himself.=Noa supposedly made this poisonous nerve gas himself. People who inhaled the gas were not able to move their bodies but remained totally conscious. Was this some kind of retribution for the audience?=This is where the officials imprisoned the performers. They searched all over for freaks and robots, keeping them here in captivity and putting on freak shows regularly. Later investigation found that several missing cases were linked to the board of officials.=The DNA found on the collar is similar to the one found at the Female Singer crime scene, but the sequence was more messy, which means Noa's skin decomposing problem was getting worse.=Noa must have blended in with the freaks after he arranged everything, and performed in the show as a "special guest".=This sculpture is of the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Messenger of Garden</color>, another of Bson's embodiments. This embodiment walked through the courtyard of the gods and presented himself in front of both humans and robots, driving out the evil indulgences suppressing them, and bringing God's electric wave to all forms of life.=These mudered officials represented the indulgent while Sheryl, in the Female Singer case, represented the arrogant. Noa's crimes followed the prophecies and legends of Bson's religious sect.=Indulgent spirits are lost in the filth, and people who find pleasure in the grotesque will be exiled by me into the abyss. Detective, without me, the sins of these people will never be purified.=Purified? You killed everyone at the scene, robots and freaks included! They suffered through so much pain, only to be murdered by you. Your so-called purification is nothing but a crazy massacre.=Both the indulgent and the abused are guilty. Only by combining the two could we neutralize the sin and restore balance. Both sides have found peace under Bson's guidance.=Don't try to excuse your crime!=Among all the victims, Noa only took a software developer's liver. If I hadn't found out about the condition Noa suffered from, I probably never would have discovered the motive for his crimes.=A new door appears. One by one, these crime scenes match things left behind by Noa: the poster, the mask, then the next scene will be...=Creepy, evil-looking clown masks adorn the curtain. There is no telling how much sin and evil they hide.=A sweet peach smell wafts out of the pipe; the scent of a specially made nerve poison. The poison paralyzes the inhaler's body, but keeps their mind clear.=These are the collars made for the "performers", on which some dissolved skin tissue was found. The DNA collected was quite similar to the DNA found at the Female Singer crime scene.=A sculpture made from several victims' bodies, which made even the most stone-faced detective sick.=Some strange, unsettling props.=A strange, X-shaped rack with some mottled dark marks on it.=These props are twisted and scary.=The operation unit of the ventilation system was purposefully destroyed, so I'll need to fix the internal circuits to adjust the fan.=The three white birds representing the key clues are all lit up now, so here comes another horrible sculpture.=Adjust the modules so they are properly connected.=Although it looks old, this is actually a rather advanced lock. By analyzing the finger prints on the buttons, we figured out the password, and I still remember <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>one button was put in twice in a row</color>.=I was right... The first of April, 2127, <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Scott Hotel Room 1023</color> in New Sinu City, a case I especially don't want to recall...=The victims were a family of four who came for a holiday at Dolphin Park. A mild genetic modification in the father led to a severe genetic disease in the daughter. They kept the disease a secret from the girl, wishing to first fulfill the girl's dream of seeing a dolphin.=They weren't expecting to meet Noa. A robot staff from the hotel was also murdered.=A fuzzy bunny rabbit toy with one eye missing... Noa lured me into his trap step by step using the victim's doll. He seems to know what I care about most of all. This is his specialty: discover the most vulnerable part of someone, then break them down slowly and methodically.=This gift can never be given back to its owner... They had been through so much pain, so much despair...=A hotel staff uniform stained with blood... Noa dressed up as hotel staff to enter the room, kill the wife, and then call back the other family members using the wife's cell phone, only to kill them as well.=A giant Bson symbol was drawn on the mirror with the wife's lipstick. It looks like an open wound.=This is the sculpture of the <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>White Feather King</color>, another of Bson's embodiments, which can reveal all lies and barriers. The meaning of this sculpture was used as Noa's motivation to kill.=I will rip off the masks of false performers. Hypocrites who hide truth from each other will be punished.=Hiding the truth from their own child to create a false happiness. Hypocrisy! It is their selfish act of genetic modification that led to the incurable disease, and they pretended to be loving and struggling parents! Deceit is against Bson's will.=I reveal the truth; I fulfill the oracle of fusion. Combined together their disease is shared and therefore the disease is no more.=Nonsense! All you do is kill innocent people while you hide behind your mask!=You gradually step closer and closer to the realm of God, towards his highest palace. I received salvation here and so shall you.=Repent in the realm of God! Your spirit gradually thins out. The Vessel is synchronizing. You do not notice, but the person in the mirror has secretly begun to change.=I have obtained the last organ. Ah!! A pain in my head... This strange wave length... I can’t stand it... I feel desperate... I feel hopeless... I feel insane.=Synchronizing... the person in the mirror has secretly begun to change... Noa mentioned the Vessel several times. His crazy words must be leading toward something else. What madness awaits me now?=A brand new bunny rabbit toy, with one of its eyes ripped off. "Elisa" is stitched on its back.=A hotel staff uniform. The owner of this uniform was killed and his body was added to the sculpture.=The reflection in the mirror has been cut in two by Bson's symbol. It looks so strange, as if there were two of me.=The window is facing Dolphin Park; the happy laughter from the park a sharp contrast to the tragedy in the room.=Legend has it that the White Feathered King once landed at a colonization base on Mars, flapping his wings to make feathery dust fall from the sky. The dust killed those who spread lies, stopping the Mars base's second great rebellion.=I am sorry, but there are no successful cures for your daughter's genetic disease. Although your husband has only been mildly genetically modified, the probability of your offspring developing genetic disease was still high. The patient's organs have developed massive lesions and she has an estimated 4 to 5 months of life remaining. Again, I'm so sorry.=Why must our girl suffer through so much pain? We should have never listened to the propaganda of that company: "mild genetic alteration will not lead to heredity disease." Our naivety ruined our daughter, my little Elisa... I hope to fulfill her dream in her finals days---to see a dolphin. This is the only thing we can do for her.=Get some rest in the room. The kids are loving the hotel pool.=The white birds are all lit up now, which means the sculpture from that case will appear soon. I really don't want to recall what happened on that day...=The husband was called back to the room by his wife's text message, and then murdered by Noa. The evidence suggests that the wife was already dead when the text was sent.=Inbox: Dr Ross=Inbox: Hubby=Sent/SMS=Honey, I feel less car sick after I had some water.=Honey, we have been picked as the lucky guests tonight!! They will give Elisa a personalized dolphin trip. Call the kids back now!=Okay!=The mailbox=Text message=The just-opened gift box, it held the rabbit doll which is now on the bed...=I can't believe there is an abandoned sanctuary here, and the stained glass on the wall is... Bson? Who would build something like this in such a gloomy place underground...=This used to be an underground factory during the Human Robot War, where robots and poor people worked day and night. It must have been abandoned after the war. Records suggest people continued to hide here.=If a God came to these people and told them he was happy to accept them, it is not surprising they would build a sanctuary for him.=Why did you turn up out of nowhere again? I could have used a friendly face back there!=A strong interruptive wave was holding me back, like I said before. But if you stay away from those signal projectors, the wave disappears.=Welcome to Bson's holy sanctuary. This is the realm of God. Repent your sins to ensure you are a clean Vessel. This is a requirement.=Stop talking nonsense! I figured out how you made those hallucinations. Without the hallucination, you can't do anything...=Have you figured it out? Am I a hallucination now? Is this holy palace a hallucination? Or...everything you have seen after you fell is only a "sweet dream" I have created for you? Hahaha.=I'm done listening to your bullshit. All I need to know is that this gun is real!=What? The bullet can't hurt him? Am I still hallucinating?=Mr. Detective, are you going to hurt me a second time with that gun? Hahaha!=You idiot! The interruptive source is on that bird face person, I can feel it. Use your brain!=I didn't expect you to bring this annoying captain with you. If you are not ready to repent your sins, then I’ll have purify you myself.=The wave interference is causing his figure to shift in and out of view, I need to think of a way to take out the entire area... Yes, the chandelier, knock the chandelier down.=Damn it! Did he escape again?... What is this?=Noa's sickle... with a signal projector. Now I understand. He's using the hallucinations to mask his true body.=There is some robot replenishing liquid, clear in color, not yet oxidized. It must have leaked out of a robot not long ago. Did Noa turn himself into a mechanical being?=If so, he'll be more difficult to handle. Anyway, Noa must have been wounded and can’t have gone too far. I need to hurry up.=An old Roverist book. It probably has the prophecy of Bson's return...=These people and this disturbing sound... Am I hallucinating again?=What are you talking about? What hallucination? There is nothing. I can't detect any interruptive signal.=You can't see it? It looks like you were right when you said these hallucinations will affect my brain permanently. I am seeing the aftermath of the hallucinations.=The fluctuations in your little head do seem more chaotic now.=Those crime scenes weren't created just to make me recall past events, but to drag me inside the hallucinations.=Looks like the situation is worse than expected. I need to get this over with quickly.=We don't need to go back now.=Some candles are still burning. Some humans or robots must still come here to worship their God.=The Goddess holds the holy mark of "directions" in her hands, which stands for the Roverism movement; the main symbol of Bson.=This colourful window is a painting of the second holy mark "twist", representing the exchange of spatial position. There is not much known about this holy mark.=Foul smelling waste water, shining with different colors, is flowing in the fountain.=Bson the Goddess will return to Earth on the day when the moon disappears. \n The Goddess collects the frequencies of all the Gods, and burns them into her circuits; With a holy flower made from melted silicon crystal on the head, her holy body is surrounded by the voice of praise. The sharp claws of the Goddess made the guards in the courtyard of the Gods bow their heads, allowing her to cross the garden, and return to the earth. \n The shapeless Goddess needs a body, half flesh and blood, half mechanical fusion. This combination will carry the will of Bson's and change the world.=Did I get him? Let's go have a look.=The investigation here is not finished yet.=Noa's sickle, with a small signal projector installed on the handle.=Noa was wounded by the chandelier. This is my chance! I've gotta get after him in the second elevator.=Noa must have used this platform, then brought down this trash heap to obstruct my pursuit. Dammit! I'll need to cycle the platforms so I can jump across.=The elevator door is stuck!=Noa used this elevator to escape. From the way he was moving, he's been badly wounded.=God knows what traps he has prepared for you down there. Be careful.=Why are you so sweet to me all of a sudden? You're not worried about me, are you?=You wish, Detective Dumbass! If you die here, I would be stuck inside this little badge, and it doesn't have much power left.=Noa used this elevator to go deeper, but now it isn't working.=Thank god, this elevator is still working! Looks like it goes pretty deep underground.=This elevator has been comprehensively trashed. No way it's taking me anywhere.=That's it! I can jump over the platforms now.=Oh my. Biological breeding tubes? Looks like someone has been doing genetic experiments. My database categorises this as a deeply illegal, banned science.=I'm not surprised. Noa is a fanatic for genetic experimentation. I can't believe we found his base so quickly.=There is only one elevator exit, which means the bird-faced man didn't come through here. Besides, I don't sense any wave signals around, so we should be safe.=I can't lower my guard. Let's check this place out first.=The hand proliferates into whisker-like granulation, adhesion of upper mucosal tissue, E grade defective product.=Atrophy below the thoracic cavity, missing internal organs, F grade defective product.=There is significant reversion, the leg tissue has not completely differentiated, the mandible appears to be gill tissue, alveolar vesicles, E grade defective product.=The legs develop into tumor-like tissues, some internal organs are missing, E grade defective product.=Mesoderm development is out of control, muscle and systemic circulatory system is disordered and proliferated, F grade defective product.=The blastocyst stage is damaged by fungal radiation, the gene fragments are completely chaotic, and the adult body is completely composed of proliferating cells, F level defective product.=The tip of the spine is split, which leads to parallel proliferation on the head. All heads lack brainstem tissues. E level defective product.=Body copying is mostly successful, and some small defects can be repaired through plastic surgery; however, the development of the prefrontal lobe in the brain is abnormal, thus unable to carry out consciousness transferrence. A grade defective product=The ocular genes and other genes are co-transcribed, and the internal organs are replaced with tissue cells such as conjunctiva lens. E grade defective product.=A lab? Is this where Noa conducted all his twisted experiments?=beep~beep~beep~=The badge is making noise again. The signal is very strong this time. This Charles you are looking for should be close by.=I hope that old man is okay. Can you sense hallucination interference nearby?=No hallucination interference here. However, there are so many complicated electronic devices in the lab. I'm sensing that... the wave bands on many of these devices have been encrypted. There must be a lot of secrets here.=Secrets, eh? We’ve lost Noa for the time being, so let’s at least figure out what he has been researching these past thirteen years.=A strange device with colorful signal lights on it. This must be equipment for handling cargo. Why was it installed here?=Don't touch it yet. There might be a switch somewhere.=Building secret passageways so far underground... This is so like Noa: sly and cautious.=A giant life support device. It wasn’t easy transporting such sophisticated equipment here. The whole thing is covered with a heavy metal curtain. That’s got to be an important detail.=Could... Noa be hiding here? This life support device has way too much encryption for me to crack. Can you open the metal curtain?=No, the encryption method is quite advanced. I can't do it either.=Let's investigate further. Maybe we can find a way to open it.=So, the robot's actions are controlled by an external signal. The implanted devices in their brains are both the input mechanism for Nano fluid, and the receiver of external control signals.=The signal projector that produces hallucinations must be an enhanced version of these implanted devices. It can receive Noa's hallucination signals, magnify them and project them. Was it designed for people who don't have implanted devices in their brain, like me?="Consciousness Transmission Device"... It seems to be able to interrupt consciousness by enhancing brain waves. Those devices we saw are only receivers. This machine here is what’s really creating the hallucinations.=This description of patient 02 can only be Noa... Sure enough, he escaped into the sewer after I shot him all those years ago.=Looks like Doc Edward saved Noa's life, and he’s been working with Noa ever since. If only he had known what the final result would be...=As I suspected, Nano fluid and the implanted devices work in tandem... And Doc Edward's name for the implant is Spark?=Luna, the doctor's wife... The experimental subjects in the test tube workshop were for her. The doctor wanted to transfer his wife's consciousness into a new body!=Was the person I met at the clinic before actually a clone cultivated here?=The operation prompt for the chain console. I should try replicating this pattern.=We are so close to finding Charles, it's too late to go back now.=A life support device covered by metallic curtains. There must be something important inside, but it can't be opened at the moment.=A vivid orange Nano fluid. It looks the same as the fluid I found at Brank's place.=This large storage server must contain Noa's research... However, the data could self-destruct if broken into.=A glass tube filled with Nano liquid. It seems far more active than the fluid from before. Is this an enhanced version?=Immersed in the liquid are organs and tissues growing in conjunction with machinery. Noa has been researching human-machine integration.=Some unknown tissues lacking a discernible shape.=Luna!=Yes, the real Luna. Poor thing... I should have guessed. No one could recover from such a horrible genetic disease.=It was only last night that I discovered Edward has been maintaining Luna's broken body using this life support equipment. He was planning to transfer his wife's consciousness into a new body using Noa's technology. However, Luna has been tortured spiritually and physically.=Char...Charles...Why...are...are you here...and you? The Vessel...=You know me? Why the hell do you know anything about me?=All this is because of you. Please stop Edward. He... is lost... in too deep...=He is gone.=I will stop him.=Noa killed Edward.=I warned him... he can't... he can't trust that person... This is for the best... at least... no more innocent lives will be lost...=I will stop him. He won't hurt anyone else.=Thanks... I hope... hope you can really... really do it. You, the Vessel...=Charles, please, turn this equipment off. I am in so much pain, I should have died a long time ago... instead of living like a monster, here like this...=I... Luna, I have known you for so many years. You and Edward were my best friends! What... what should I do?=Friend, tell me, if you were me, what would you do?=Turn off the equipment=Leave the equipment on=I will end her pain. She has been through too much.=Thank you, Detective. Luna will finally be free from pain.=I can't end someone's life like this. Charles, let's wait for the police.=I see... but Luna, wait! Maybe we can set everything right. Something just occurred to me. We can use the notes left behind by Edward.=Luna will be free, which is the best result.=I don't want you to continue the research, Charles. It's banned for good reasons!=Don't worry, friend, I'm not like Edward. I just want to reduce Luna's pain.=Eh, Detective, are you alright? You look like you're in pretty bad shape.=I'm not hurt, but Noa's hallucinations have been influencing me this whole time. I feel more and more strange...=Hallucinations? Can someone without an implanted device be influenced too? You only have half a electronic brain, don't you?=I can tell you about that.=Angela, are you feeling better? Have you remembered anything?=When I was controlled by the - what did you call it - Nano fluid? I still had some hold on my own consciousness, so I know something about their plan. All this was done to get you here, beginning when I delivered the parcel to you...=They have another machine, but it isn't here. A machine that was designed just for you.=Yes, I can remember easier now! From the moment you first touched the device in the parcel, each touch pulls you deeper and deeper into the hallucinations, and each hallucination was designed specifically to synchronize your brain waves to that machine.=According to what they said, if the synchronization is allowed to finish, your own consciousness will be erased and your body will...=Will become the Vessel for Noa? Ha! This is ridiculous! All this was done for my broken body?=Ah, your body is very special. Looks like you are not aware of what your body can do. Your body is something people dream to have.=According to Angela, you must stop entering the hallucinations. If you are robbed of your body, then who knows what Noa will do.=Noa... Every day he is allowed to walk free on this planet, more people will be deceived and hurt. I can't let this continue.=I see you've made up your mind. If you're this determined to beat him, then there must be a way.=After I was captured, Edward shared a lot of the research about consciousness transmission. Now, I reckon that the Consciousness Transmission Device can work both ways.=Charles, what are you getting at?=When you are dragged into the hallucinations, you are connected with that equipment. Or, you are connected with the person who is controlling that equipment. Aha! And if your will is strong enough, you might be able to influence the consciousness of that person instead!=You mean...I can alter the hallucinations?=Yes! But it won't be easy. You'd better think it through before meeting Noa.=I don't know who this Noa is, but that doctor took that elevator deep down below - deeper than I've ever been.=Hiding even deeper underground? That's where my final battle is.=I am sorry, Mr. Detective. I hurt you, but it was not of my own will.=Never mind, I'm used to being hurt by beautiful women. Your friend Brayden will be thrilled to know you’re still alive.=Brayden...who is that? Maybe I haven't got all my memory back yet.=Please take care of yourself, Mr. Detective.=How will you deal with the research? It can't fall into the wrong hands.=Don't worry, I'll take care of it. This Nano fluid was originally developed for good purposes, even if that good purpose was forgotten along the way...=About that "Consciousness Transmission Device", when you find Noa, please... Just destroy it. Are you comfortable with what you're about to do?=I've just notified Nanco. He will report everything to the police.=…...=I adjusted the life support tube to put Luna back to sleep. That will reduce her pain.=Oh... What are you doing here?=Me? I need some air after being stuck in that badge for so long. But, Detective Dumbass... Watch out, okay? To me it seems like everything is a big trap designed for you by whoever this Noa character is. Are you really going to walk right into it?=Of course I am. I will run him down, springing whatever trap he has set along the way.=You sound confident! Maybe you should consider making a copy of your consciousness. That way if you fail, you can go on with your detective game in Electrode State.=Thanks for your advice...but, nah. I am not interested in Electrode State.=I gave the badge to Charles. You can count on him to release you.=Though I don’t really care... hopefully you can get out of here alive, Detective Dumbass.=The elevator will take me to Noa, but there is no turning back. Ready to go?=Leave=Wait a minute=Noa, I'm coming to rough you up. One last time.=Get prepared before leaving.=The life support system has completely stopped working.=Date of admission: 31/09/2127=A diagram explaining the relationship between the Nano liquid and the signal projector.=The blueprint for a "Consciousness Transmission Device". This huge machine can be used to interrupt people's brain wave frequency.=A patient report that matches Noa's conditions.=A research note on Nano fluid=Mechanism: Invades electronic brains via Nano robot liquid, turns off the independent consciousness program, and at the same time uses the Spark implant to control the behaviors of mechanical bodies.=Achievements: Currently, it is completely possible to control robots injected with Nano liquid. The only drawback is that the efficacy of the Nano fluid reduces quickly. Extended control requires a continuous injection.=Questions: The Spark implant was found in the brain of the robot provided by Patient 02. This device has the ability to break through an electronic brain's defenses. More functions have been developed in subsequent studies. However, the origin of the device remains a mystery, and Patient 02 refuses to disclose more information.=Observation Record of Patient: Luna=Patient name: Luna=Preface: The patient began showing symptoms in the fifth year of marriage and was diagnosed with a hereditary genetic disease. \nDuring the early stage, chemotherapy suppressed the symptoms, but the effects of the genetic disease on the organs gradually spread. \nDuring the middle stage, parts of the patients' organs were replaced with artificial organs, and the patient had to survive inside a sterile life support cabin. \nWith the technical support of Patient 02, attempts are being made to project Luna's brainwaves into a robot using Spark. \nBack-Up: Cloning Luna with somatic cells, and brainwave transmission into an organic vessel afterward.=Patient number: 02=Preliminary Diagnosis: An infection caused by a gunshot wound and a severe genetic disease.\n\nDetails: the patient was originally found in the East District sewers. He was transferred to a sterile incubation pool to maintain his chance of survival. \nTargeted medicine was used to control symptoms, and the patient himself proposed special medical and chemical theories. Due to these theories, the treatments for Luna and Patient 02 were adjusted. Consciousness implantation has become the leading research direction.=The investigation is still underway. I can't leave now.=beep~beep~beep~=I can sense the signal again. Charles must be close by.=Is this the elevator...? Yes, the robot replenishing liquid is fresh, so it must be the elevator Noa used to escape. Dammit, he made a shortcut to his secret corridor.=What?! This is Noa's black robe! How come it was left here? Looks like he was badly hurt.=The replenishing liquid disappeared here. That guy must be...=Let me out! Please! Anyone?=Hear that? Someone's calling for help behind the door.=It's Charles! Thank god he's still alive! Are he and Noa both behind that door?!=I only sense one organic life, but there is indeed another unusual wave. Be careful when you go in there.=Huh? These clothes. The delivery guy who gave me the parcel was wearing these. Everything began with that parcel.=A bunch of odds and ends. No, these things belonged to the victims. Watches, bracelets, hats... the owners won't be coming to retrieve them anymore.=Although I told you it may be possible to fight against the hallucinations, it will be extremely difficult. Think it through!=Don't worry about me, Charles. I've done this before. Now you take Angela and leave as quickly as possible. Captain Ramrod here knows the way out.=Thank you. I'll see you back on the surface, Detective.=Be careful, Detective Dumbass. Come back alive. You have to take me back to the Destiny Fire!=Such sweet words from an AI... Maybe I will try and survive after all.=Hydraulic oil drips slowly down the elevator's metal railings. Noa used this elevator.=The hydraulic oil is all over the floor, and the wall.=The courier uniform used by whoever pretended to be a delivery person to give me that parcel.=Stuff that belonged to the victims was left randomly on the floor.=A worn-out robe connected to the bird face mask, discarded and crumpled on the floor.=Bastard! Let me out! Edward!! Think about what you're doing!!!=Charles! Thank God you're still alive!=Who’s there? Eh... haha, Detective Rex, it’s you!! Wow, am I lucky. How did you find this place? Come on, get me out!=Is this...? My photo... on that board?=This information is from back when I first returned to Starlight City after my "mechanization" was completely stabilized. Thanks to Abel's sacrifice at the Apocalypse Garden Incident, I wouldn't even be alive today. Has Noa been studying me all this time?=What the... Noa refers to me as a Vessel in the records, and the date circled in red is the date when I received the parcel.=He's been after me since the beginning... Vessel...=This is Doc Edward's diary.=This robot... from the wounds on the body, was probably dressed up as the Noa I attacked earlier... Where is that man?!=Wait! I remember this robot! Yes, Angela, the missing waitress from the Fantasy Jellyfish. I was way too drunk to even remember taking that job... Why her, where is the real Noa?=The wave fluctuation from her is the same as the bird-face man we saw earlier.=The Nano liquid must be controlling her, and repairing her wounded body gradually. I have to stop it now.=I wouldn't waste your time. Once this equipment starts running, it seems it cannot be stopped. In order to prevent accidents, the robot is locked in the machine.=That bastard! He only uses innocent people. Let’s get Charles out first. Maybe he knows how to stop the device.=The document next to the device says: Beta Type Consciousness Transmission Device. It can enhance brain waves, interrupt other people's consciousness, and eventually infuse self-consciousness onto a receptor, controlling that person.=This seems to be an unfinished product still under testing. If Noa and the doctor had succeeded in perfecting this machine, they would be able to control absolutely anyone. Human, robot... it wouldn't matter.=Don't try to open this door with your little body. Even someone as strong as me can't open it. Go find something to pry it open! Hurry up! We’re running out of time!=Whew! Well, you’re not controlled anymore.=Wh- what is this place? Who are you?=Don’t be afraid, little girl. I have already temporarily suppressed the Nano fluid’s control over you. And I'll give you a good cleaning up when we get back to my workshop.=Thank god you're here, Charles! Her name is Angela. She's been under control since being kidnapped by the doctor. She was even dressed up as Noa earlier!=Detective, I am completely shocked by this affair. This was the work of Edward, and that Noa guy. Once I checked the sample you gave me, I knew it was Edward who made it. He is very talented when it comes to Nano robots. I couldn’t imagine he...=After so many years, I couldn't imagine him making such a terrifying thing...=Hur...hurry up...that spooky doctor, if he comes back...=Don't worry, Angela, the doctor is not going to return.=What? Did you... er, chat... with him?=No, it was Noa, or rather, Angela... but this is not important anymore. Doc Edward is gone.=He wasn't like this in the beginning. He did it all for Luna. He was used by that guy because of his love for Luna!=Angela, please. Can you tell us anything that could help us find Noa?=Who is Noa? I... I don't know... I'm so confused right now. I feel like I had the longest dream. I did awful things in the dream, even though I didn't want to. Those humans and robots were all...=Easy, Rex. Let her calm down first. She was just freed from the Nano fluid’s control.=Well, in that case, you and I should go back to the lab, Charles. There's some kind of giant life support tank up there, and I want to crack it open.=Oh, no, that was not Noa, that was... Let's go, I'll show you.=This...What's going on? What happened?=Let her have a rest first. We will come back to her after checking the life support tank. Maybe she will be able to tell us something by then.=Let's get Charles out before we go.=Angela is firmly locked in this equipment, and the Nano liquid is flowing into her body.=The control panel of the Nano liquid equipment. I can't break through the high-end encryption to access it.=An empty Nano liquid injection cabin. It's been unused for a long time, and the entrance is blocked.=If the prototype product of the "Consciousness Transmission Device" is completed, it could even transfer human consciousness to other bodies.=06.2129: The brain wave of the vessel is not stable. Probably the mechanical transplantation has traumatized the brain; 21.2131: The sequela of the vessel seems to have eased down, and the hysterism has improved; 02.2135: The internal machine has merged with the organic parts well, which meets the requirement of a vessel to hold Bson's holy body. 21.10.2140: The ceremony begins.=[10/12/2127]=The weirdest thing happened today. I found a bird-faced man in the sewer near the clinic. He was weak, near death, severe wounds, infections and genetic diseases ate away at his body. Huddled in that sewage, he might have died at any moment. But he didn't even ask me for help. Instead, the masked face said: "You need me."=And he was right! He can help me cure Luna. This... Noa... has accumulated a vast knowledge of chemistry and biology, and most importantly, he possesses the kind of madness that goes hand in hand with using long-banned technologies...=[4/21/2136]=I saved him, as much as I can. And in return, the bird-faced man has guided me step-by-step to <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>resurrect</color> my Luna. I didn't want to hurt those robots, but... well, I had no choice. I failed to transfer Luna's thoughts into the original subjects. Only the memories made it into the subjects. Luna's personality was not transplanted successfully.=Today we had a breakthrough. That monster is truly a genius. By using Spark and Nano liquid, we managed to actually control robots! Nobody will believe it. We used a Consciousness Transmission Device to remotely send signal waves, and transmit consciousness into the robots’ bodies! Although, it is not perfect yet - I can only currently control those robots remotely. More work needed to save Luna...=[11/4/2137]=Consciousness Transmission Device \nIt's a brainwave amplifying and transmitting device, based on Spark, which transfers the user's consciousness to another receiver. When the receiver is human, only the user's memory can be transmitted because of the block from the “special personality" that is unique to human beings.=I'm working day and night now, and always that monster is there at my shoulder. At this stage, consciousness transmission onto mechanical receivers is under development. Obstacles in the research. The user of the transmission device can only project part of his consciousness onto the mechanical receiver, just enough to initiate a kind of remote control. But this is not enough.=[9/17/2139]=Failure. But although the test subject experiment failed, I improved that Consciousness Transmission Device. Luna, you will soon return to me with a mechanical body! I haven't told the monster about this. He is just using me, and the robots controlled by Spark seem to have gone beyond my control too.=I have a plan. Once the experiment is over, I will take you away from this country to an unknown island. Let that monster go to hell!=This board is covered with information on me! Noa has been systematically monitoring and studying my half-mechanical body for years. The last date marked is the day the mystery package was received. This appears to have been a well-laid plan...=On the table are all kinds of information and research reports... all about me.=Where... where am I? I remember repairing myself, and now I am in... the sewer?=Noa! That's right, he attacked me from behind with that... scythe? I’m surprised how much restoration this crappy machine was able to do. Falling from such height, my body was almost shattered.=I have to get back to that sculpture. Noa must be stopped. How do I get there, though? I don't even know where I am.=Meow~ Meow~ Meow~=William, why are you... Oh, yeah. You did me a big favor earlier.=Meow~woo. Meow~ Meow~=What are you trying to tell me? Are you going to take me somewhere? You were able to find me, so you should know how to get back up there. Let's go, little fella.=I used this equipment to fix my mangled body. I'm surprised it managed the job!=Thanks for your knees, matey. No offense, but I'll be replacing them in the morning. They stink of rat piss.=The power generator has been juiced dry by that repair work.=I can't find anything useful in the cupboard anymore.=Meow! Meow~ Meow~=That's the way?=There’s no need to go there. There’s nothing but air valves and rat holes.=Follow William now, there is nothing much to look at in this repair room.=The sculpture! This is the place. Good on you, William! You’ll get a nice reward after all this.=Meow~ Meow~=I was attacked by Noa here. He might still be around. I must be vigilant.=That sound? Ugh, my head... this feels...=Huh!? What's going on? It’s gone, the sculpture and everything! Don't tell me I was just hallucinating!=I thought contact with an implant device was the only way to trigger a hallucination. But this time... a perfect hallucination was created without one. And Noa was lurking inside this hallucination...? First things first. Let's inspect this device.=Let's start with this sculpture.=There are traces of a violent impact on this iron door. Probably from when Noa was chasing after me.=The core of this weird device... is the same as <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>the implanted device</color> inside Brank's brain. Is this thing creating the hallucinations?=Instead of creating hallucinations, I think this thing is more like a <color%3D#FF3E3EFF>signal projector</color>. The core receives external signals, amplifies them and then projects them.=Huh? Why are you here? I thought you couldn’t leave that old ship?=I noticed that little thing you have on you has an amazingly large storage capacity. So, I decided to follow you and check out how you’d deal with that guy in the mask.=But once I got here, I felt a strange electrical disturbance, and got stuck in that little thing! I was coding my way out when suddenly I was free to leave.=Meow~ Meow~ Meow~=The little thing you mentioned... You were inside the badge from Lola? When I got here, the badge lost signal. The disturbance you’re talking about must be from this device, right?=Yes, this device has been receiving and amplifying some sort of electrical wave, but that should only influence robots. You seem to have a strong reaction to it, though. Is most of your body mechanical? What a rare success story!=Why does everyone know about my physical condition? Never mind, seems like Noa made this thing as a trap for me.=This electrical wave may continue influencing your special little brain. You need to be careful. I can see it's much less stable than when we first met.=It’s hard to describe, but I think I can feel the disturbance in my mind...=beep~beep~beep~beep~=Hey! The badge suddenly activated. This signal... must be sent from Charles!=The signal came from the elevator shaft on the right. The signal is faint, but it’s definitely there.=Okay, let's go have a look. I hope Noa didn’t put that old man on the experiment bench.=Thanks, little fella. I think it's time I promoted you to being my full-time partner. That means when I give orders, you can follow them.=Hmph! Meow~Meow~=But it’s going to get very dangerous from now on, so you should head back home. If something happens to you because of me, your little girlfriend Elizabeth wouldn't stop pissing in my plant pots.=This elevator...looks creepy. Is it still working?=If we go further ahead, we will arrive at the abandoned ship plant, and there is nothing more worth looking into.=Nothing but strange fungi and trash.=A broken iron gate, with a lots of steps going down=A signal projector with implant devices as the core, capable of projecting hallucination signal waves. It has been destroyed by William.=Sparkling lake water... This must be the Light Lake that mentioned in the holographic message... According to Noa, he's expecting me to undergo some kind of test down here. In the most beautiful place lives the darkest soul.=Drifting on the clear lake water, the perfect Vessel is purified and brought to me. A body of both flesh and machine will pave the way for Bson's arrival.=The time for rebirth has come. I have waited far too long for this. Come here and sing an ode to my new life.=Bson's Eye comes at my call, and its gaze penetrates those who pretend to be righteous. Come feel the heat that goes into one's soul.=Wait, Bson's Eye? If my memory isn't shot from all that drinking, this stands for the Eye of Punishment that clears hypocrisy. Like Charles said, if I can focus, I can redirect Noa's attacks, or perhaps even use the attacks in my favour...=The final game has just started, Detective. Now I shall watch you run from the light! Like the insignificant cockroach you are!=You are good, Detective. I have made the right decision in choosing you as the Vessel. But your resistance is futile.=Yeah, yeah. You are losing the game, Noa! Let’s get this over with.=Those possessing the hubris to challenge God shall fail. Anyone who meets the eye of the God, shall plummet from the greatest height. Detective, I have had enough with this game, this is where your life ends!=No! No! No! I will neverrrr lose! How is it possssible for you to brrrreak through my halluccccination?!=This flesh... Noa?! Is this how you look now? In a state like this... Are you even a human being anymore?=Ssssomething must have gone wrrrrong. Bson makessss no make misssstakes! The ceremony, the doctorrrr, you, these have all been arrrranged. No, thissss can't be right!=You have been relying on the Consciousness Transmission Device to obtain the power to control others. Noa, your sick, inhuman device failed to save you, and instead turned you into a monster.=Your body belongssss to me. My dissssease is a test from God, for which I wassss abandoned and despised. I was forced to sufferrrr the most unimaginable pain. Bson made a deal with me: a new body if I pass the test, a new body...=All this is just your own imagination! Noa, stop lying to yourself.=… Ha ha ha... Detective, do you think this issss the end? I am just a small parrrrt of the darknessss. As long as robots and humans exist, the crrrracks will not dissssappear.=Are you... curioussss why robots have that device in their brrrrains? I didn't put the device there.. I just made an alterrrration...=There is darknessss inside darknessss. I am not the only one who wants to turn this ugly worrrrld upside down...=Who first made the implant device?=You will neverrrr know, Detective... I am going to Bson now... assss for you, there are bombssss everywhere in this place... You will die with me...=Hahaha... Hahaha! Blow it up!! Blow everything up!!!=The ignorant wanderer. Stupid little detective, bow your head and witness Bson's final embodiment... The Omniscient Judge!=Where is this elevator taking me? Charles' signal is getting stronger.=Noa was researching far more than just Nano fluid and implant devices. If that signal projector is truly what the Captain described, then even without coming into contact with an implant device, it could influence the minds of robots everywhere...=Beep! Beep! Beep!=Wakey, wakey. It's time to get up!=Geez, you are so loud! What are you doing BB-X! Do you want to be taken apart and rebuilt?=I need to perform a routine check-up on your mechanical parts. It's four days overdue!=Sure, whatever. Just wait for me over there and I'll come to you...=Okay, let's get this over and done with...=Body scan in progress...=According to the scan, 98% of your mechanical parts are brand new. I can't believe you survived such a massive explosion, and even got your old parts replaced with new ones!=Haha, you better believe it! Old Charles has got the good stuff, even parts that are only available in Sky City.=Ah, yes, about our... guests. They can't just stay in our house like this. Especially that arrogant little robot! You don't have enough money to support six people.=Look, BB-X, we talked about this. They have nowhere to go. And the cash situation? Well, we just haven't had a lot of jobs lately.=That's because you keep turning them away!! There is a customer this morning, waiting for you downstairs. Go have a look and don't say no! And remember to get a deposit this time!=Your BB-X robot is really lovely, like a kind of motherly matron. It always wakes me up in the sweetest of ways. Cup of tea, lullabye, the morning's news... And these cats are lovely, too! I like this white one.=This white cat used to belong to Mrs. Perry, but after she, er, died, William brought her to my place, along with many other street cats. What a headache...=Are you well? After replacing so many parts and organs, I expected your body to reject some, but... you don't seem to be experiencing any side effects.=Ha! This is a walk in the park for me. Charles is a really good technician, and I feel brilliant now!=Thanks for finding my grandpa and letting us stay here. You can come to me for mechanical maintenance. I am almost as good as he is when it comes to fixing mechanical parts.=You did me a big favor, William. I have been meaning to study you more closely. You are so much smarter than other cats.=Meow, meow.=Although Charles is an expert on robots, I wonder if we can ask him to do some research on William. Strap him down, lazer through the skull...=Ssss~ Meow~ Meow~=What, you don’t like that? Maybe I should research you myself instead!=William is proudly telling the other cats something. It must be the story of how he helped the dumb detective defeat the bad guy.=This fat cat is sleeping again, and he seems to have made himself comfortable in my laundry basket.=You have a new message=Missed calls (12)=Message from: Angela=Hello, Mr. Detective. How have you been? I just want to tell you that without your help, I’d probably still be doing evil deeds under the control of those people. I can't thank you enough! But I'm sad I can't go back to work at the Fantasy Jellyfish or Bellflower House.\nI haven't once told anyone about Noa or the kidnap, just like you asked me to. People keep asking me where I've been, and what I've been up to, which makes me remember...\nBut the whole thing has come to an end. I think I left the Bellflower House just to see the world outside Underbridge. Maybe this is what the real world is like, a world of bad people like Noa and good people like you. I have decided to leave Starlight City to see a bigger world and I will be sending you postcards during my trip. \nBy the way, I still can't recall who Braden is. Forget about it, he must not be that important.=Royde=Dialling=on call=So many calls. Looks like Royde hasn't given up. Never mind, let's see what he wants, there will be trouble if he has to come to me.=Hi, Rex, you finally called me back. When are you going to tell me more about that case? I am under a lot of pressure from my superiors. Don't make this so hard for me.=Haha, Royde, I’ve told you everything I know. It was a real miracle the King even let you into the Underbridge District for investigation.=Hey, don't play dumb with me. We had a hard time with people in the Underbridge for two weeks, but ended up with a pile of relics. Only unknown broken robots' bodies and fungi. There was a lab down there, wasn't there?=I don't know where it came from, but we have information that says what Noa and the doctor were working on was relevant to revolutionary riots. Now my superiors are going crazy, urging me to investigate anything and everything. They want answers!=It looks like you're working very hard, but it’s exactly like told you. I haven't found Noa. I'm just the victim of an explosion.=Alright Rex, you're not ready to tell me the truth yet. I really hope you aren't involved in this. You know how sensitive this is for the superiors.=Forget it. Look, do you want to have a drink at the Fantasy Jellyfish? I have a friend I'd like you to meet.=You're trying to get me drunk so I'll talk? You must be even more desperate than you sound. Well, see you tonight then.=The closing notes for the Noa case are at the bottom of the display cabinet. I will go through them again when I have time. There are still so many questions that remain unanswered.=A brand new poster. Charles must have replaced the old one.=What's this? Charles has been through my wardrobe? Eugh, and what's that smell... fabric conditioner?!=Crisp packets, a half-eaten donut... Those blasted kids have been hiding in here.=The model is naked. The bird mask and the files have been put away in the attic. For good?=I could kiss BB-X for fixing the washing machine... if he hadn't then gone and bought a "Roses and Lime" fabric conditioner. This stuff absolutely stinks!=Time for a quick morning beer-me-up. What? Juice and yogurt?! I'm gonna murder those kids...=I didn't expect this incident to cause such a big aftershock...=But it has got me thinking... The Mrs. Perry murder happened before Noa sent me his gift. The timing of the crime and the crime scene evidence both indicate that it wasn't done by Noa. There must be someone else who used the implant device to help the butler robot break the three principles.=Didn't Noa say something about simply altering devices that were there already..? If that's correct, what does the original maker of these devices have planned?=Maybe what Noa said was true: there are layers of darkness that fold over each other deeper and deeper.=Was that sound an explosion in the attic? Charles must be doing dangerous research again.=That Charles needs to leave this house this instant! He is an awful old man!=Wow, this outfit... I didn't think Captain Ramrod would be seen dead in clothes like these.=You, you, shut up! It's all because of that old man. He told me that he was adding me to the detective office network, but he was actually just changing my code to put me in this stupid outfit!=You look good in them! Next time, you should ask Charles...=What did you say?=Nothing! I was just saying... ah, um... I will go find Charles now. What is the old man thinking?=You'd better hurry up. Me, a captain, in this outfit?! It’s humiliating!=She is still hot-tempered. I don't know what Charles is up to up there. I just hope he won’t blow the attic up.=What happened? Why is there a smoking riot robot in the attic?=The modification failed. Ahem... Thank God this is not my workshop, or I would have to pay to repair it.=Spacious place you have here, Rex. And again, thank you for letting us hide out here. The King and the police are still trying to find anyone involved in the explosion.=Letting you? I didn’t exactly have much choice. You insisted on moving in... Is this the robot from Morax's Shop?=Yes. That young man owed me, so he gave me this robot to pay the debt. If I can alter this robot successfully, it will greatly improve our combat prowess.=Looks like the robot's nearly ready... Wait, our? Are you never going to go back to Underbridge District? What about the doctor's research? And his wife Luna?=I processed Edward's research data before we escaped the lab. It is some very advanced technology, but maybe too advanced for this day and age.=As for Luna, the life support tank was too big to move, and the explosion... She was buried underground with Edward's lab.=In the end she and Edward are together forever after all... There's one more thing on my mind. Before he died, Noa mentioned that he was not the one who created the implant devices. Even though this case has been cracked, there's still another layer that I can't quite see.=In that case, we'd better get this riot robot working post haste!=Ah, I see. The thermo dump plating is routed through the auxiliary cooling system. Damn, another lockout code! Did Morax install a protection program inside this thing?=Grandpa Charles' experiments are so dangerous, so I'd better watch from far away.=Hmmm, this armour is well crafted. There are special switches inside, and if the wearer doesn’t understand how they work, he can never take it off again.=That's why! No wonder William was stuck in there, but I did see a cluster of black...=Oh, hello fellow Detective! Are you awake? Don't worry about the explosion, grandpa knows what he is doing. It's just that his tools are still in Underbridge, and we can't go retrieve them right now.=Nanco, do you know what's happening in Underbridge? You've got a lot of connections there.=I guess since I'm living here there's no reason not to tell you. The king sent lots of people to dig up the remnants of the lab, hoping to find something useful. After an explosion like that, I don't think there is much left though.=One more thing you might be interested in: Luna from Edward's clinic has gone missing.=The Luna from the clinic? That is a clone of Edward's wife. Maybe she's gone to start a new life of her own.=What's your plan now, Detective? With Noa gone, you have accomplished what you set out to do so many years ago.=Don't you worry about me. I can sit back and help old grandmas find lost cats until the end of my days now!=I feel BB-X doesn't like me. Is it because I am a better model?=The white board has been cleaned, and the past has been sealed away. The case that remained unsolved for fifteen years is finally cracked.=Didn't expect to see you here, Miss Fancy Feather... Did you come all the way down here to give me this new VR game console?=Hehehe! Oh Mr. Detective, are you playing with me? This is what you will travel in to Coral City.=<color%3D#FF3E3EFF>Coral City</color>?! You want me to visit the electronic world? Sorry Miss, er, Feather, but I'm not going back there.=Hehehe, I knew you would say no. Take a look at this first, and you may change your mind.=The Coral City, hurry, go tell Rex. What we have been hiding there might...have been found... by someone.=Hurry...be quick, the Coral City...Those guys...they want to...=What!? These are... MK Type I Riot Troopers. The manufacture of them was banned after the war between the humans and robots. Never thought I'd see them here.=这么大阵仗吗......果然是来者不善啊。=Why are you standing at the door?=Fancy Feather! It's Fancy Feather! It was Fancy Feather who made the appointment. Her squad of minions have taken over our living room!=Why is she here? We're a long way from Underbridge.=Let's bust in and wipe them out, just like old times! I can enter riot control mode anytime.=Calm down. Let's hear them out first.=What? Abel?! But he's dead! Where did you get this video?=This video clip was sent from the Electrode State last night. If you act quickly, you may be able to buy some time...=You seem to know a lot of things, Miss Fancy Feather.=That's because, as stars align, so do our interests. Now, Mr. Detective. Are you ready to go?=Looks like I have no other choice, Abel...=Bottle of Volatile Fluid=Air Lock Device=Broken Emergency Lamp=Main Valve Wrench=Simply throw it, but make sure you don't miss.=A light valve-cutting device, which can be installed and dismantled as required.=The glass interior layer is intact, so things can be poured into it.=An extra large valve wrench, which can be used to turn the main valve.=Throat Organ Model=Liver Organ Model=Kidney Organ Model=A throat organ that shows Noa's lesion.=A liver organ that shows Noa's lesion.=A kidney organ that shows Noa's lesion.=Crowbar="Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."

It emits a regular electrical pulse sound when activated, and this ticking sound is key to determining the presence of devices around you.  The core implanted device receives external signals first, then amplifies the signals and sends them out by the circular Oscilloscope Synapse, and forms around itself an extremely wide signal field .\nThis electromagnetic signal field theoretically has no effect on humans, but Rex replaced half of his brain with an electronic brain which keeps a sequela called “Fantasy Vision", which is capable of receiving external electric brain signals without discrimination. This allowed the signal field of the projection device to act on him, creating hallucinations in his brain. From this tailored structure, it can be concluded that Noa prepared this device intentionally for Rex's special physical condition.=During the Human Robot War, a large number of factories serving the war were built underground to escape the precision bombardment of the smart weapons.After the war was over, this place was shut down. Nevertheless, there were still a large amount of chemical materials and raw radioactive materials remaining here, which over a long period of time, mutated the underground fungi. The fungi are full of deadly poison, and as the poisonous materials spread deeper into the underground water circulation, this mutation may extend above the ground. \n On the other hand, for fear of war, some of the workers from this time fled deeper underground, and as the factories closed, these people gradually became the owners of the place. Some of the people who had been abandoned by the above-ground society were also drawn here, and the scale of the underground population was expanding, and the factory and the city sewage system grew and connected gradually. This place has become a shadow city that exists like a mirror image of Starlight City.=Of all the gods in Roverism, Bson is one of the few that would show themselves in this world. Bson owns many embodiments, the image that is worshipped by the follows is the Goddess embodiment named “Real View Judge” who is also referred to by the name "she". \nThe most common holy mark of Bson is an upside down triangle combined with a cross, which stands for "direction", and according to the first chapter of Bson's Holy Cannon, "Bson opens up her arms, and arrives in our world from the realm of the Gods, and the holy mark is formed", this mark meaning the trace of movement and the direction of infusion. This is a Bson symbol well known among people. \n But in the early days of Roverism, a group of followers insisted that they had discovered the second holy mark of Bson - the "twist", which represented the change of space and position. Some patriarchs believed that the "twist" holy mark did not refer to space, but to the twisting of the nature of things. It begs the followers to speculate that Bson may represent more than just combination. However, this explanation that went against the religious doctrine had soon been left behind, along with the "twist" holy mark. At present, only some branches that developed from long ago still remember the second holy mark.=The UN has banned clone technology since the 21st century, and during the later part of the new century, human beings have shifted their focus onto research on the technology of genetic rewriting. As genetic diseases appeared, people have become more sensitive and cautious about biochemical technologies, which led to the temporary suspension of relevant technologies. \nAfter the government's brief restart of the organ clone plan, some people found the instability of cell cloning had increased because of many years of interruption from radioactive rays of electronic products, and cloned organs were produced with an impressive amount of malformation and mutation. A success rate less than 2% was typical. Several mechanical limb companies launched a joint condemnation at this time, which led to criticism of this technology from all walks of life. In this case, the clone technology was again shelved; however, secret research on this technology among nongovernmental entities has never stopped.\nBecause clones are not born through a maternal body but in a nutritious liquid, the most prominent character of them is the absence of a belly button.=Nano fluid, signal source and the implanted device named Spark are connected in a cooperative state. \n The implanted devices inside robots’ brains are called Sparks by Noa and Dr. Edward, and this kind of mysterious device receives external signal sources and sends them to the electronic brains of receivers with accurate positioning. However, typical robot brains are equipped with a defensive system, which will block out the signals coming from the Spark. \n In order to unarm the electronic brains, Dr. Edward invented the Nano liquid. When injected with the Nano liquid, the Nano robots inside the liquid will invade a robot's electronic brains and break down the defensive system. After the defenses are down, Spark can send the signal from the source into the electronic brains and thus control the robot's behavior.=This equipment is derived from Dr. Edward’s Spark, but on a much grander scale. It is named the "Consciousness Transmission Device”, later seized by Noa. Theoretically, this equipment seems to have reversed the receiving function of Spark, combined with forbidden consciousness transferring technology, to convey the user's thoughts, or brain waves, to a specific receiver. \nBased on Dr. Edward's materials, if completed, this equipment can transfer the user's consciousness to another body for a body-swapping effect.This technique is reminiscent of the "immortality" technology that Sky City may be secretly developing. \nHowever, the current phase of research shows that when the receiver of the transmission device is a human being, only the user's memory can be transmitted to the brain because of the obstacle of the human's natural “personality”. In order to avoid the "personality" of the organic being, Dr. Edward used a robot as a receiver to break through the defenses of the electronic brain by combining Spark and Nano fluid in an attempt to bring his wife's consciousness into a robot's body. But at this time it's only possible to control the robot remotely. If this strange half finished product were developed further, it could likely form an army. Is this a surprise?=Edward and his wife, Luna, had already come to the area before it was integrated by the King. The unique academic temperament of the couple drew Charles' attention. In their interaction, it was learned that Dr. Edward and his wife, both originally professors and lecturers at a university, had to hide out in the Underbridge District because some of their technological developments had attracted some attention. With Charles' recommendation and help, Edward opened a clinic that accepted both human and robot patients. It was not easy in the beginning, but the clinic quickly gained trust and recognition because of the doctor's skills and sense of responsibility. \n However, Luna developed a genetic condition shortly afterwards. Edward told others it was just a mildly chronic disease, but since then, Luna has disappeared from the public eye. After years of failure to find a cure, Edward began trying some banned technologies, and the clinic with previously saved many lives became the source of test subjects. In one of the test subject deliverie, Edward came across the wounded Noa. The two devils with different intentions began working together. \n After disappearing for years, Luna reappeared at Edward's clinic one day, seeming to have recovered from a chronic illness. She looked the same as before, which was a cause for concern.=The history of the case: The "Sculpture" serial murder case, which remained unsolved for fifteen years. \n The murderer: Noa \n Details of the case: \n The first crime was committed in 2125, when Noa, who suffered from a genetic disease, pieced together the remains of human and robot victims into sculptures, creating a series of cases that were reported by police as a serial killing. He committed the murders based on the prophecies recorded in the Roverism Cannon, and the sculptures were the images of different embodiments of "Bson, the God of combinition and communication". During an police-terminating mission in 2127, Noa was wounded by special police team member Rex, but Not managed to escape in the end. \n He was accidentally saved by Dr. Edward in Underbridge, and the doctor decided to work together with Noa in hopes of treating his genetically-diseased wife. During their cooperation, these two people kidnapped and killed many innocent people and developed Nano liquid and consciousness transmission technology which controls robots. \n In October 2140, former special police team member Rex received a package from Noa. During the chase, Noa deliberately created a series of clues while also killing Dr. Edward". \n Noa planned to seize Rex's half mechanical body using the consciousness transmission technology. He constantly synchronizing his own brain waves with Rex through hallucinations, as he lured Rex deeper into the base. He was defeated by Rex in their final battle, but he managed to ignite the bombs in his base, and he had his hard end there. Rex managed to escape in the end without any life-threatening wounds. \n Case state: Closed case \n Case file state: Sealed on 15/11/2140=Abandoned underground factory=Ventilation chamber=Bson's holy place underground=Path to the elevator=Test tube workshop=A secret lab=Light Lake in the Hallucination=10.22.2140\nSaturday Night=10.22.2140\nSaturday Night=10.22.2140\nSaturday Midnight=10.22.2140\nSaturday Midnight=10.23.2140\nSunday Early Morning=10.23.2140\nSunday Early Morning=10.23.2140\nSunday Dawn=A steam control room=The theatre dressing room=A cruise function room=Scott Hotel, Room 1023=10.22.2140\nSaturday Night=10.22.2140\nSaturday Midnight=10.22.2140\nSaturday Midnight=10.22.2140\nSaturday Midnight=A repair room in the sewer=An unknown sewer=Inside the abandoned cabin=A secret corridor=Inside a secret room=10.22.2140\nSaturday Night=10.22.2140\nSaturday Night=10.22.2140\nSaturday Night=10.23.2140\nSunday Early Morning=10.23.2140\nSunday Early Morning=Wake Up.
